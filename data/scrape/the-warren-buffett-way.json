    "Preface": "Almost exactly twenty years ago, while training to become an investment broker with Legg Mason, I received a Berkshire Hathaway annual report as part of the training materials. It was my\nvery first exposure to Warren Buffett.\nLike most people who read Berkshire’s annual reports, I was instantly impressed with the clarity of Buffett’s writing. As a young professional during the 1980s, I found that my head was perpetually\nspinning as I tried to keep up with the stock market, the economy, and\nthe constant buying and selling of securities. Yet, each time I read a\nstory about Warren Buffett or an article written by him, his rational\nvoice seemed to rise above the market’s chaos. It was his calming inf luence that inspired me to write this book.\nThe principal challenge I faced writing The Warren Buf fett Way\nwas to prove or disprove Buffett’s claim that “what [I] do is not beyond\nanybody else’s competence.” Some critics argue that, despite his success,\nWarren Buffett’s idiosyncrasies mean his investment approach cannot be\nwidely adopted. I disagree. Warren Buffett is idiosyncratic it is a source\nof his success—but his methodology, once understood, is applicable to\nindividuals and institutions alike. My goal in this book is to help investors employ the strategies that make Warren Buffett successful.\nThe Warren Buf fett Way describes what is, at its core, a simple approach. There are no computer programs to learn, no two-inch-thick\ninvestment manuals to decipher. Whether you are financially able to\npurchase 10 percent of a company or merely a hundred shares, this book\ncan help you achieve profitable investment returns.\nBut do not judge yourself against Warren Buffett. His five decades\nof simultaneously owning and investing in businesses make it improbable that you can imitate his historical investment returns. Instead, compare your ongoing results against your peer group, whether that group\nincludes actively managed mutual funds, an index fund, or the broader\nmarket in general.\nThe original edition of this book enjoyed remarkable success, and I\nam deeply gratified that so many people found it useful. The success of\nThe Warren Buf fett Way, however, is first and foremost a testament to\nWarren Buffett. His wit and integrity have charmed millions of people\nworldwide; and his intellect and investment record have, for years, mesmerized the professional investment community, me included. This unparalleled combination makes Warren Buffett the single most popular\nrole model in investing today.\nI had never met Warren Buffett before writing this book, and I did\nnot consult with him while developing it. Although consultation\nsurely would have been a bonus, I was fortunate to be able to draw\nfrom his extensive writings on investing that date back more than four\ndecades. Throughout the book, I have employed extensive quotes from\nBerkshire Hathaway’s annual reports, especially the famous Chairman’s Letters. Mr. Buffett granted permission to use this copyrighted\nmaterial, but only after he had reviewed the book. This permission in\nno way implies that he cooperated on the book or that he made available to me secret documents or strategies that are not already available\nfrom his public writings.\nAlmost everything Buffett does is public, but it is loosely noted.\nWhat was needed, in my opinion, and what would be valuable to investors, was a thorough examination of his thoughts and strategies\naligned with the purchases that Berkshire made over the years, all compiled in one source. And that was the starting point for the original\nedition of The Warren Buf fett Way.\nThis revised edition, ten years later, retains that basic goal: to examine Buffett’s more recent actions for the investment lessons they hold\nand to consider whether changes in the financial climate have triggered\nchanges in his strategies.\nSome things became clear quickly. Buffett’s level of activity in the\nstock market has dropped off significantly in recent years; he has bought\nentire companies more often than he has bought shares. He has on occasion moved more strongly into bonds—investment-grade corporate,\ngovernment, even high-yield—and then, when they became less attractive, moved out again.\nSome of these newly acquired companies are profiled in the chapters\nthat follow, along with a discussion of how the characteristics of those\ncompanies ref lect the tenets of the Warren Buffett Way. However, since\nmany of these companies were privately held before Buffett bought\nthem, the specifics of their financial data were not publicly available. I\ncannot, therefore, discern with any confidence what Buffett might have\nthought of those companies’ economic conditions, other than to say that\nhe clearly liked what he saw.\nFor this updated edition, I also took the opportunity to incorporate\nsome material that was not presented in the original book. I added a\nchapter on Buffett’s style of portfolio management, a style he has labeled\n“focus investing.” It is a cornerstone of his success, and I highly recommend it. I also included a chapter on the psychology of money, the many\nways that emotion plays havoc with good decisions. To invest wisely, it\nis necessary to become aware of all the temptations to behave foolishly.\nIt is necessary for two reasons: If you know how to recognize the emotional potholes, you can avoid tripping into them. And you will be able\nto recognize the missteps of others in time to profit from their mistakes.\nTen years is either a very long time, or not long at all, depending on\nyour circumstances and your personal view of the world. For investors,\nwhat we can say is that during these ten years, context has changed but\nthe basics have not. That’s good, because in another ten years the context can change back again, or change in an entirely different direction.\nThose who remain grounded in basic principles can survive those upheavals far better than those who do not.\nIn the ten years since I wrote The Warren Buf fett Way, the noise\nlevel in the stock market has continued to rise, sometimes to a deafening\nscreech. Television commentators, financial writers, analysts, and market\nstrategists are all overtalking each other to get investors’ attention. At the\nsame time, many investors are immersed in Internet chat rooms and message boards exchanging questionable information and misleading tips.\nYet, despite all this available information, investors find it increasingly\ndifficult to earn a profit. Some are hard pressed even to continue. Stock\nprices skyrocket with little reason, then plummet just as quickly. People\nwho have turned to investing for their children’s education and their\nown retirement are constantly frightened. There appears to be neither\nrhyme nor reason to the market, only folly.\nFar above the market madness stand the wisdom and counsel of\nWarren Buffett. In an environment that seems to favor the speculator\nover the investor, Buffett’s investment advice has proven, time and\nagain, to be a safe harbor for millions of lost investors. Occasionally,\nmisaligned investors will yell out, “But it’s different this time”; and occasionally they will be right. Politics spring surprises, markets react,\nthen economics reverberate in a slightly different tone. New companies\nare constantly born while others mature. Industries evolve and adapt.\nChange is constant, but the investment principles outlined in this book\nhave remained the same.\nHere is a succinct and powerful lesson from the 1996 annual report:\n“Your goal as an investor should be simply to purchase, at a rational\nprice, a part interest in an easily understood business whose earnings are\nvirtually certain to be materially higher, five, ten, and twenty years from\nnow. Over time, you will find only a few companies that meet those\nstandards—so when you see one that qualifies, you should buy a meaningful amount of stock.”\nWhatever level of funds you have available for investing, whatever\nindustry or company you are interested in, you cannot find a better\ntouchstone than that.\nROBERT G. HAGSTROM\nVillanova, Pennsylvania\nSeptember 2004",
    "Introduction": "My father, Philip A. Fisher, looked with great pride on Warren\nBuffett’s adoption of some of his views and their long and\nfriendly relationship. If my father had been alive to write this\nintroduction, he would have jumped at the chance to share some of the\ngood feelings he experienced over the decades from his acquaintance\nwith one of the very few men whose investment star burned so brightly\nas to make his dim by comparison. My father genuinely liked Warren\nBuffett and was honored that Buffett embraced some of his ideas. My\nfather died at 96—exactly three months before I received an unexpected letter asking if I would write about my father and Warren Buffett. This introduction has helped me to connect some dots and provide\nsome closure regarding my father and Mr. Buffett. For readers of The\nWarren Buf fett Way, I hope I can provide a very personal look into an\nimportant piece of investment history and some thoughts on how to\nbest use this wonderful book.\nThere is little I will say about Mr. Buffett since that is the subject of\nthis book and Robert Hagstrom covers that ground with grace and insight. It’s well known that my father was an important inf luence on\nWarren Buffett and, as Mr. Hagstrom writes, my father’s inf luence figured more prominently in Buffett’s thinking in recent years. For his\npart, as my father became acquainted with Warren Buffett, he grew to\nadmire qualities in him that he felt were essential to investing success\nbut are rare among investment managers.\nWhen he visited my father 40 years ago, in a world with relatively\nprimitive information tools by today’s standards, my father had his own\nways of gathering information. He slowly built a circle of acquaintances\nover the decades—investment professionals he respected and who knew\nhim well enough to understand what he was and wasn’t interested in—\nand who might share good ideas with him. Toward that end, he concluded that he would meet any young investment professional once. If he\nwas impressed, he might see him again and build a relationship. He\nrarely saw anyone twice. Very high standards! In his mind, if you didn’t\nget an “A” you got an “F.” And once he had judged against someone, he\nsimply excluded that person, forever. One shot at building a relationship.\nTime was scarce.\nWarren Buffett as a young man was among the very, very few who\nimpressed my father sufficiently in his first meeting to merit a second\nmeeting and many more meetings after that. My father was a shrewd\njudge of character and skill. Unusually so! He based his career on judging people. It was one of his best qualities and a major reason why he put\nso much emphasis on qualitative judgment of business management in\nhis stock analysis. He was always very proud he picked Warren Buffett as\nan “A” before Buffett had won his much-deserved fame and acclaim.\nThe relationship between Warren Buffett and my father survived\nmy father’s occasional lapses when he would mistakenly call Mr. Buffett\n“Howard.” This is an unusual story that has never been told and perhaps\nsays much about both my father and Warren Buffett.\nMy father was a small man with a big mind that raced intensely.\nWhile kindly, he was nervous, often agitated, and personally insecure.\nHe was also very, very much a creature of habit. He followed daily catechisms rigorously because they made him more secure. And he loved to\nsleep, because when he slept, he wasn’t nervous or insecure. So when he\ncouldn’t stop his mind from racing at night, which was often, he played\nmemory games instead of counting sheep. One sleep game he played was\nmemorizing the names and districts of all the members of Congress until\nhe drifted off.\nStarting in 1942, he memorized the name of Howard Buffett and associated it with Omaha, over and over again, night after night, for\nmore than a decade. His brain mechanically linked the words “Omaha,”\n“Buffett,” and “Howard as a related series long before he met Warren\nBuffett. Later, as Warren’s career began to build and his star rose, it was\nstill fully two decades before my father could fully disentangle Buffett\nand Omaha, from “Howard.” That annoyed my father because he\ncouldn’t control his mind and because he was fond of Warren Buffett\nand valued their relationship. Father knew exactly who Warren Buffett\nwas but in casual conversation he often said something like, “That\nbright young Howard Buffett from Omaha.” The more he said it, the\nharder it became to eliminate it from his phraseology. A man of habit\nhabitually vexed.\nEarly one morning when they were to meet, my father was intent on\nsorting out “Howard” from “Warren.” Still, at one point in the conversation, my father referred to Warren as “Howard.” If Warren noticed,\nhe gave no sign and certainly did not correct my father. This occurred\nsporadically throughout the 1970s. By the 1980s, my father finally had\npurged the word “Howard” from any sentence referencing Buffett. He\nwas actually proud when he left “Howard” behind for good. Years later,\nI asked him if he ever explained this to Warren. He said he hadn’t because it embarrassed him so much.\nTheir relationship survived because it was built on much stronger\nstuff. I think one of the kernels of their relationship was their shared\nphilosophy in associating with people of integrity and skill. When\nMr. Buffett says in regard to overseeing Berkshire Hathaway managers,\nWe don’t tell .400 hitters how to swing,” that is almost straight from\nPhil Fisher’s playbook. Associate with the best, don’t be wrong about\nthat, and then don’t tell them what to do.\nOver the years, my father was very impressed with how Mr. Buffett\nevolved as investor without compromising any of his core principles.\nEvery decade, Mr. Buffett has done things no one would have predicted\nfrom reading about his past, and done them well. Within professional investing, most people learn in craft-like form some particular style of investing and then never change. They buy low P/E stocks or leading tech\nnames or whatever. They build that craft and then never change, or\nchange only marginally. In contrast, Warren Buffett consistently took\nnew approaches, decade-after-decade—so that it was impossible to predict what he might do next. You could not have predicted his 1970s franchise orientation from his original strict value bent. You could not have\npredicted his 1980s consumer products orientation at above market average P/Es from his previous approaches. His ability to change—and do it\nsuccessfully—could be a book unto itself. When most people attempt to\nevolve as he has—they fail. Mr. Buffett didn’t fail, my father believed,\nbecause he never lost sight of who he was. He always remained true to\nhimself.\nMy father was never physically far for very long from Rudyard\nKipling’s famous poem, “If.” In his desk, by his nightstand, in his den—\nalways close. He read it over and over and quoted it often to me. I keep\nit by my desk as part of keeping him close to me. Being insecure but undaunted, he would tell you in Kipling-like fashion to be very serious\nabout your career and your investments, but do not take yourself too seriously. He would urge you to contemplate others’ criticisms of you, but\nnever consider them your judge. He would urge you to challenge yourself, but not judge yourself too extremely either way and when in your\neyes you’ve failed, force yourself to try again. And he would urge you to\ndo the next thing, yet unfathomed.\nIt is that part about Mr. Buffett, his knack for evolving consistent\nwith his values and past—doing the next thing unfathomed—that my\nfather most admired. Moving forward unfettered by the past restraints,\nutterance, convention, or pride. Buffett, to my father’s way of thinking, embodied some of the qualities immortalized by Kipling.\nUnfortunately, there will always be a small percent of society, but a\nlarge absolute number, of small-minded envious miscreants who can’t\ncreate a life of their own. Instead they love to throw mud. The purpose\nof life for these misguided souls is to attempt to create pain where they\ncan’t otherwise create gain. By the time a successful career concludes,\nmud will have been thrown at almost everyone of any accomplishment.\nAnd if any can stick, it will. My insecure father always expected mud\nto be thrown at everyone, himself included, but for those he admired,\nhe hoped it would not stick. And when mud was thrown, he would\nexpect those he admired, in Kipling-like fashion, to contemplate the\ncriticism or allegation without feeling judged by it. Always through\nKipling’s eyes!\nThrough a longer career than most, Warren Buffett has acquitted\nhimself remarkably—little mud has been thrown at him and none has\nstuck. A testament indeed. Kipling would be pleased. As was my father.\nIt goes back to Mr. Buffett’s core values—he always knows exactly who\nhe is and what he is about. He isn’t tormented by conf licts of interest\nthat can undermine his principles and lead to less-than-admirable behaviors. There was no mud to throw so no mud stuck. And that is the\nprime part of Warren Buffett you should try to emulate. Know who\nyou are.\nI am writing this introduction in part to suggest to you how to use\nthis book. Throughout my career, people have asked me why I don’t\ndo things more like my father did or why I don’t do things more like\nMr. Buffett. The answer is simple. I am I, not them. I have to use my\nown comparative advantages. I’m not as shrewd a judge of people as my\nfather and I’m not the genius Buffett is.\nIt is important to use this book to learn, but don’t use this book to\nbe like Warren Buffett. You can’t be Warren Buffett and, if you try, you\nwill suffer. Use this book to understand Buffett’s ideas and then take\nthose ideas and integrate them into your own approach to investing. It is\nonly from your own ideas that you create greatness. The insights in this\nbook are only useful when you ingest them into your own persona\nrather than trying to twist your persona to fit the insights. (A twisted\npersona is a lousy investor unless you’re twisted naturally.) Regardless, I\nguarantee that you cannot be Warren Buffett no matter what you read\nor how hard you try. You have to be yourself.\nThat is the greatest lesson I got from my father, a truly great teacher\nat many levels—not to be him or anyone else, but to be the best I could\nevolve into, never quitting the evolution. The greatest lesson you can\nglean from Warren Buffett? To learn from him without desiring to be\nlike him. If you’re a young reader, the greatest investment lesson is to\nfind who you really are. If you’re an old reader, the greatest lesson is\nthat you really are much younger than you think you are and you\nshould act that way—a rare gift. Were that not possible, then Mr. Buffett wouldn’t still be ably evolving at what for most people is postretirement age. Think of Warren Buffett as a teacher, not a role model,\nand think of this book as the single best explanation of his teachings,\nwell stated and easily learned. You can learn an enormous amount from\nthis book and that can be the foundation for developing your own successful investment philosophy.\nKENNETH L. FISHER",
    "The World’s Greatest Investor": "Every year, Forbes magazine publishes a list of the 400 richest Americans, the elite Forbes 400. Individuals on the list come and go\nfrom year to year, as their personal circumstances change and their\nindustries rise and fall, but some names are constant. Among those leading the list year in and year out are certain megabillionaires who trace\ntheir wealth to a product (computer software or hardware), a service\n(retailing), or lucky parentage (inheritance). Of those perennially in the\ntop five, only one made his fortune through investment savvy. That\none person is Warren Buffett.\nIn the early 1990s, he was number one. Then for a few years, he seesawed between number one and number two with a youngster named\nBill Gates. Even for the dot-com-crazed year 2000, when so much of\nthe wealth represented by the Forbes 400 came from the phenomenal\ngrowth in technology, Buffett, who smilingly eschews high-tech anything, was firmly in fourth position. He was still the only person in the\ntop five for whom the source of wealth” column read “stock market.”\nIn 2004, he was solidly back in the number two position.\nIn 1956, Buffett started his investment partnership with $100; after\nthirteen years, he cashed out with $25 million. At the time of this writing (mid-2004), his personal net worth has increased to $42.9 billion,\nthe stock in his company is selling at $92,900 a share, and millions of\ninvestors around the world hang on his every word.\nINVESTMENT BEGINNINGS\nWarren Edward Buffett was born August 30, 1930, in Omaha, Nebraska.\nHis grandfather owned a grocery store (and once employed a young\nCharlie Munger); his father was a local stockbroker. As a boy, Warren\nBuffett was always fascinated with numbers and could easily do complex\nmathematical calculations in his head. At age eight, he began reading his\nfather’s books on the stock market; at age eleven, he marked the board at\nthe brokerage house where his father worked. His early years were enlivened with entrepreneurial ventures, and he was so successful that he\ntold his father he wanted to skip college and go directly into business. He\nwas overruled.\nBuffett attended the business school at the University of Nebraska,\nand while there, he read a new book on investing by a Columbia professor named Benjamin Graham. It was, of course, The Intelligent Investor.\nBuffett was so taken with Graham’s ideas that he applied to Columbia\nBusiness School so that he could study directly with Graham. Bill Ruane,\nnow chairman of the Sequoia Fund, was in the same class. He recalls that\nthere was an instantaneous mental chemistry between Graham and Buffett, and that the rest of the class was primarily an audience.1\nNot long after Buffett graduated from Columbia with a master’s degree in economics, Graham invited his former student to join his company, the Graham-Newman Corporation. During his two-year tenure\nthere, Buffett became fully immersed in his mentor’s investment approach\nIn 1956, Graham-Newman disbanded. Graham, then 61, decided to\nretire, and Buffett returned to Omaha. Armed with the knowledge he\nhad acquired from Graham, the financial backing of family and friends,\nand $100 of his own money, Buffett began a limited investment partnership. He was twenty-five years old.\nThe partnership began with seven limited partners who together contributed $105,000. The limited partners received 6 percent annually on\ntheir investment and 75 percent of the profits above this bogey; the remaining 25 percent went to Buffett, who as general partner had essentially free rein to invest the partnership’s funds.\nOver the next thirteen years, Buffett compounded money at an annual rate of 29.5 percent.2 It was no easy task. Although the Dow Jones\nIndustrial Average declined in price five different years during that\nthirteen-year period, Buffett’s partnership never had a down year. Buffett, in fact, had begun the partnership with the ambitious goal of outperforming the Dow by ten points every year. And he did it—not by\nten—but by twenty-two points!\nAs Buffett’s reputation grew, more people asked him to manage\ntheir money. For the partnership, Buffett bought controlling interests\nin several public and private companies, and in 1962 he began buying\nshares in an ailing textile company called Berkshire Hathaway.\nThat same year, 1962, Buffett moved the partnership office from\nhis home to Kiewit Plaza in Omaha, where his office remains today.\nThe next year, he made a stunning purchase.\nTainted by a scandal involving one of its clients, American Express\nsaw its shares drop from $65 to $35 almost overnight. Buffett had\nlearned Ben Graham’s lesson well: When stocks of a strong company are\nselling below their intrinsic value, act decisively. Buffett made the bold\ndecision to put 40 percent of the partnership’s total assets, $13 million,\ninto American Express stock. Over the next two years, the shares tripled\nin price, and the partners netted a cool $20 million in profit. It was pure\nGraham—and pure Buffett.\nBy 1965, the partnership’s assets had grown to $26 million. Four\nyears later, explaining that he found the market highly speculative and\nworthwhile values increasingly scarce, Buffett decided to end the investment partnership.\nWhen the partnership disbanded, investors received their proportional interests. Some of them, at Buffett’s recommendation, sought out\nmoney manager Bill Ruane, his old classmate at Columbia. Ruane\nagreed to manage their money, and thus was born the Sequoia Fund.\nOthers, including Buffett, invested their partnership revenues in Berkshire Hathaway. By that point, Buffett’s share of the partnership had\ngrown to $25 million, which was enough to give him control of Berkshire Hathaway.\nWhat he did with it is well known in the investment world. Even\nthose with only a passing interest in the stock market recognize Buffett’s\nname and know something of his stunning success. In the following\nchapters, we trace the upward trajectory of Berkshire Hathaway in the\nforty years that Buffett has been in control. Perhaps more important,\nwe also look beneath the surface to uncover the commonsense philosophy on which he founded his success.\nWarren Buffett is not easy to describe. Physically, he is unremarkable,\nwith looks often described as grandfatherly. Intellectually, he is considered a genius; yet his down-to-earth relationship with people is\ntruly uncomplicated. He is simple, straightforward, forthright, and\nhonest. He displays an engaging combination of sophisticated dry wit\nand cornball humor. He has a profound reverence for all things logical\nand a foul distaste for imbecility. He embraces the simple and avoids\nthe complicated.\nWhen reading Berkshire’s annual reports, one is struck by how comfortable Buffett is quoting the Bible, John Maynard Keynes, or Mae\nWest. The operable word here is reading. Each report is sixty to seventy\npages of dense information: no pictures, no color graphics, no charts.\nThose who are disciplined enough to start on page one and continue uninterrupted are rewarded with a healthy dose of financial acumen, folksy\nhumor, and unabashed honesty. Buffett is candid in his reporting. He\nemphasizes both the pluses and the minuses of Berkshire’s businesses. He\nbelieves that people who own stock in Berkshire Hathaway are owners\nof the company, and he tells them as much as he would like to be told if\nhe were in their shoes.\nWhen Buffett took control of Berkshire, the corporate net worth was\n$22 million. Forty years later, it has grown to $69 billion. It has long\nbeen Buffett’s goal to increase the book value of Berkshire Hathaway at\na 15 percent annual rate—well above the return achieved by the average\nAmerican company. Since he took control of Berkshire in 1964, the gain\nhas been much greater: Book value per share has grown from $19 to\n$50,498, a rate of 22.2 percent compounded annually. This relative performance is all the more impressive when you consider that Berkshire is\npenalized by both income and capital gains taxes and the Standard &\nPoor’s 500 returns are pretax.\nOn a year-by-year basis, Berkshire’s returns have at times been\nvolatile; changes in the stock market and thus the underlying stocks that\nBerkshire owns create wide swings in per share value (see Table 1.1).\nTo appreciate the volatility, compare the results for 1998 with 1999.\nIn 1998, Berkshire’s value increased more than 48 percent. Then, in\n1999, Berkshire’s increase dropped to a paltry 0.5 percent, yet the S&P\n500 increased 21 percent. Two factors were involved: Berkshire’s results\ncan be traced to poor return on consumer nondurables (Coca-Cola and\nGillette), while the S&P increase was fueled by the outstanding performance of technology stocks, which Berkshire does not own.\nSpeaking with the candor for which he is famous, Buffett admitted\nin the 1999 annual report that “truly large superiorities over the [S&P]\nindex are a thing of the past.”3 He predicted, however, that over time\nBerkshire’s performance would be “modestly” better than the S&P. And\nfor the next three years, this turned out to be the case. Then in 2003,\neven though Berkshire had a terrific year—book value up 21 percent—\nthe S&P did even better.\nOver the most recent years, starting in the late 1990s, Buffett has been\nless active in the stock market than he was in the 1980s and early 1990s.\nMany people have noticed this lack of activity and have wondered\nwhether it signaled that the market had hit its top. Others have theorized that the lack of new major purchases of common stocks simply\nmeans that the type of stocks Buffett likes to purchase are no longer\nselling at attractive prices.\nWe know it is Buffett’s preference to “buy certainties at a discount.” “Certainties” are defined by the predictability of a company’s\neconomics. The more predicable a company’s economics, the more certainty we might have about its valuation. When we look down the list\nof stocks that Buffett owns as well as the wholly owned companies inside Berkshire, we are struck by the high degree of predictability ref lected there. The “discount” part of the statement obviously refers to\nthe stock price.\nKnowing that Buffett likes to buy highly predictable economics at\nprices below the intrinsic value of the business, we can conclude that his\nbuyer’s strike ref lects the lack of choices in this arena. I am pretty sure\nthat if Coca-Cola, Gillette, or other similar businesses were today selling\nat fifty cents on the dollar, Buffett would add more shares to Berkshire’s\nportfolio.\nWe also know Buffett’s discipline of operating only within his “circle of competence.” Think of this circle of competence as the cumulative\nhistory of your experience. If someone had successfully operated a certain\nbusiness within a certain industry for a decade or more, we would say\nthat person had achieved a high level of competence for the task at hand.\nHowever, if someone else had only a few years’ experience operating a\nnew business, we could reasonably question that person’s level of competence. Perhaps in Buffett’s rational mind, the sum total of his business\nexperience in studying and operating the businesses in Berkshire’s portfolio sets the bar of competence so high that it would be difficult to\nachieve a similar level of insight into a new industry.\nSo perhaps Buffett faces a dilemma. Within his circle of competence, the types of stocks he likes to purchase are not currently selling at\ndiscounted prices. At the same time, outside his circle of competence,\nfaster-growing businesses are being born in new industries that have yet\nto achieve the high level of economic certainty Buffett requires. If this\nanalysis is correct, it explains why there have been no new large buys of\ncommon stocks in the past few years.\nWe would be foolish indeed to assume that because the menu of\nstocks available for purchase has been reduced, Warren Buffett is left\nwithout investment options. Certainly he has been active in the fixedincome market, including taking a significant position in high-yield\nbonds in 2002. He is alert for the periodic arbitrage opportunity as well,\nbut considering the amount of capital Buffett needs to deploy to make\nmeaningful returns, the arbitrage markets are perhaps not as fruitful as\nthey once were.\nBut Berkshire Hathaway shareholders should not feel they are being\ndeprived of opportunities. Too often, shareholders forget one of the\nmost important owner-related business principles Buffett outlines each\nyear in the annual report. The fourth principle states, “Our preference\nwould be able to reach our goal [of maximizing Berkshire’s average annual rate of gain in intrinsic value] by directly owning a diversified\ngroup of businesses that generate cash and consistently earn aboveaverage returns on capital. Our second choice is to own parts of similar\nbusinesses attained primarily through the purchases of marketable common stocks.”\nIn Berkshire’s early years, owning common stocks made the most\nsense economically. Now, as common stock prices have risen dramatically and the purchasing power of Berkshire’s retained earnings has\nmushroomed, the strategy of buying whole businesses, which is Buffett’s\nstated preference, has come to the forefront.\nThere is a personal factor as well. We know that Buffett greatly enjoys his relationships with his operating managers and takes a great deal\nof pride in Berkshire’s collection of operating businesses. Conversely,\nthe angst he has endured by being a shareholder of publicly traded companies, with the issues of executive compensation and questionable\ncapital reinvestment strategies that accompany ownership, may make\nbeing a shareholder less appealing for Buffett today than it used to be.\nIf the economics are not compelling, why would Buffett choose to endure the corporate governance fiascos associated with being a major\nshareholder?\nThe only activity Buffett involves himself in with Berkshire’s operating businesses is setting executive compensation and allocating the profits. Inside Berkshire’s world, these decisions are highly rational. Outside\nin the stock market, management decisions on executive compensation\nand capital reallocation do not always ref lect rationality.\nWhat does this mean for individual investors? Because Buffett is not\nactively involved in the stock market, should they automatically pull\nback as well? Buffett’s alternative strategy is to buy businesses outright,\nan option that is out of reach for most investors. So how should they\nproceed?\nThere appear to be two obvious choices. One is to make an investment in Berkshire Hathaway and so participate in the economics of\nthese outstanding businesses. The second choice is to take the Buffett\napproach to investing, expand your circle of competence by studying\nintently the business models of the companies participating in the New\nEconomy landscape, and march ahead.\nI believe that the fundamental principles that have so long guided\nBuffett’s decisions are uncompromised, and they still carry opportunities for careful investors to outperform the S&P 500. The purpose of\nthis book is to present those principles in a way that thoughtful investors can understand and use.",
    "“Our Main Business Is Insurance” The Early Days of Berkshire Hathaway": "Very few people can come close to Warren Buffett’s investment\nrecord, and no one can top it. Through four decades of market\nups and downs, he has continued on a steady course with unmatched success. What he does is not f lashy, even at times very much\nout of favor, and yet over and over, he has prevailed over others whose\nexploits gave them temporary, f lash-in-the-pan stardom. He watches,\nsmiles, and continues on his way.\nHow did Buffett come to his investment philosophy? Who inf luenced his thinking, and how has he integrated their teachings into action? To put the question another way, how is it that this particular\ngenius turned out so differently?\nWarren Buffett’s approach to investing is uniquely his own, yet it\nrests on the bedrock of philosophies absorbed from four powerful figures: Benjamin Graham, Philip Fisher, John Burr Williams, and Charles\nMunger. Together, they are responsible for Buffett’s financial education,\nboth formal and informal. The first three are educators in the classic\nsense, and the last is Buffett’s partner, alter ego, and pal. All have had a\nmajor inf luence on Buffett’s thinking; they have much to offer modernday investors as well.\nBENJAMIN GRAHAM\nGraham is considered the dean of financial analysis. He was awarded\nthat distinction because “before him there was no [financial analysis]\nprofession and after him they began to call it that.”1 Graham’s two most\ncelebrated works are Security Analysis, coauthored with David Dodd,\nand originally published in 1934; and The Intelligent Investor, originally published in 1949.\nSecurity Analysis appeared just a few years after the 1929 stock\nmarket crash and in the depths of the nation’s worst depression. While\nother academicians sought to explain this economic phenomenon,\nGraham helped people regain their financial footing and proceed with a\nprofitable course of action.\nGraham began his career on Wall Street as a messenger at the brokerage firm of Newburger, Henderson & Loeb, posting bond and stock\nprices on a blackboard for $12 a week. From messenger, he rose to\nwriting research reports and soon was awarded a partnership in the\nfirm. By 1919, he was earning an annual salary of $600,000; he was\ntwenty-five years old.\nIn 1926, Graham formed an investment partnership with Jerome\nNewman. It was this partnership that hired Buffett some thirty years\nlater. Graham-Newman survived the 1929 crash, the Great Depression,\nWorld War II, and the Korean War before it dissolved in 1956.\nFrom 1928 through 1956, while at Graham-Newman, Graham\ntaught night courses in finance at Columbia. Few people know that\nGraham was financially ruined by the 1929 crash. For the second time in\nhis life—the first being when his father died, leaving the family financially unprotected—Graham set about rebuilding his fortune. The haven\nof academia allowed him the opportunity for ref lection and reevaluation.\nWith the counsel of David Dodd, also a professor at Columbia, Graham\nproduced what became the classic treatise on conservative investing: Security Analysis. Between them, Graham and Dodd had over fifteen years\nof investment experience. It took them four years to complete the book.\nThe essence of Security Analysis is that a well-chosen diversified\nportfolio of common stocks, based on reasonable prices, can be a sound\ninvestment. Step by careful step, Graham helps the investor see the logic\nof his approach.\nThe first problem that Graham had to contend with was the lack of a\nuniversal definition for investment that would distinguish it from speculation. Considering the complexities of the issue, Graham proposed his\nown definition. “An investment operation is one which, upon thorough\nanalysis, promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return. Operations\nnot meeting these requirements are speculative.”2\nWhat did he mean by “thorough analysis”? Just this: “the careful\nstudy of available facts with the attempt to draw conclusions therefrom\nbased on established principles and sound logic.”3\nThe next part of Graham’s definition is critical: A true investment\nmust have two qualities—some degree of safety of principal and a satisfactory rate of return. Safety, he cautions, is not absolute; unusual or\nimprobable occurrences can put even a safe bond into default. Rather,\ninvestors should look for something that would be considered safe from\nloss under reasonable conditions.\nSatisfactory return—the second necessity—includes not only income but also price appreciation. Graham notes that “satisfactory” is a\nsubjective term. Return can be any amount, however low, as long as the\ninvestor acts with intelligence and adheres to the full definition of\ninvestment.\nHad it not been for the bond market’s poor performance, Graham’s\ndefinition of investing might have been overlooked. But when, between\n1929 and 1932, the Dow Jones Bond Average declined from 97.70 to\n65.78, bonds could no longer be mindlessly labeled pure investments.\nLike stocks, not only did bonds lose considerable value but many issuers\nwent bankrupt. What was needed, therefore, was a process that could\ndistinguish the investment characteristics of both stocks and bonds from\ntheir speculative counterparts.\nGraham reduced the concept of sound investing to a motto he\ncalled the “margin of safety.” With this motto, he sought to unite all\nsecurities, stocks, and bonds in a singular approach to investing.\nIn essence, a margin of safety exists when securities are selling—for\nwhatever reason—at less than their real value. The notion of buying\nundervalued securities regardless of market levels was a novel idea in the\n1930s and 1940s. Graham’s goal was to outline such a strategy.\nIn Graham’s view, establishing a margin-of-safety concept for bonds\nwas not too difficult. It wasn’t necessary, he said, to accurately determine\nthe company’s future income, but only to note the difference between\nearnings and fixed charges. If that margin was large enough, the investor\nwould be protected from an unexpected decline in the company’s income. If, for example, an analyst reviewed the operating history of a\ncompany and discovered that, on average, for the past five years the company was able to earn annually five times its fixed charges, then that\ncompany’s bonds possessed a margin of safety.\nThe real test was Graham’s ability to adapt the concept for common\nstocks. He reasoned that if the spread between the price of a stock and\nthe intrinsic value of a company was large enough, the margin-of-safety\nconcept could be used to select stocks.\nFor this strategy to work systematically, Graham admitted, investors\nneeded a way to identify undervalued stocks. And that meant they\nneeded a technique for determining a company’s intrinsic value. Graham’s definition of intrinsic value, as it appeared in Security Analysis,\nwas “that value which is determined by the facts.” These facts included\na company’s assets, its earnings and dividends, and any future definite\nprospects.\nGraham acknowledged that the single most important factor in determining a company’s value was its future earnings power, a calculation\nthat is bound to be imprecise. Simply stated, a company’s intrinsic value\ncould be found by estimating the earnings of the company and multiplying the earnings by an appropriate capitalization factor. The company’s\nstability of earnings, assets, dividend policy, and financial health inf luenced this capitalization factor, or multiplier.\nGraham asked us to accept that intrinsic value is an elusive concept.\nIt is distinct from the market’s quotation price. Originally, intrinsic\nvalue was thought to be the same as a company’s book value, or the sum\nof its real assets minus obligations. This notion led to the early belief that\nintrinsic value was definite. However, analysts came to know that the\nvalue of a company was not only its net real assets but also the value of\nthe earnings that these assets produced. Graham proposed that it was not\nessential to determine a company’s exact intrinsic value; instead, investors should accept an approximate measure or range of value. Even an\napproximate value, compared against the selling price, would be sufficient to gauge margin of safety.\nThere are two rules of investing, said Graham. The first rule is don’t\nlose. The second rule is don’t forget rule number one. This “don’t lose”\nphilosophy steered Graham toward two approaches for selecting common\nstocks that, when applied, adhered to the margin of safety. The first approach was buying a company for less than two-thirds of its net asset\nvalue, and the second was focusing on stocks with low price-to-earnings\n(P/E) ratios.\nBuying a stock for a price that is less than two-thirds of its net assets\nfit neatly into Graham’s sense of the present and satisfied his desire for\nsome mathematical expectation. Graham gave no weight to a company’s\nplant, property, and equipment. Furthermore, he deducted all the company’s short- and long-term liabilities. What remained would be the net\ncurrent assets. If the stock price was below this per share value, Graham\nreasoned that a margin of safety existed and a purchase was warranted.\nGraham considered this to be a foolproof method of investing, but\nhe acknowledged that waiting for a market correction before making an\ninvestment might be unreasonable. He set out to design a second approach to buying stocks. He focused on stocks that were down in price\nand that sold at a low P/E ratio. Additionally, the company must have\nsome net asset value; it must owe less than its worth.\nOver the years, many other investors have searched for similar shortcuts for determining intrinsic value. Low P/E ratios—Graham’s first\ntechnique—was a general favorite. We have learned, however, that making decisions on P/E ratios alone is not enough to ensure profitable\nreturns. Today, most investors rely on John Burr Williams’s classic definition of value, described later in this chapter: The value of any investment is the discounted present value of its future cash f low.\nThe basic ideas of investing are to look at stocks as businesses,\nuse market f luctuations to your advantage, and seek a margin\nof safety. That’s what Ben Graham taught us. A hundred years\nfrom now they will still be the cornerstones of investing.\nBoth of Graham’s approaches—buying a stock for less than twothirds of net asset value and buying stocks with low P/E multiples—had\na common characteristic. The stocks that Graham selected based on\nthese methods were deeply out of favor with the market. Some macroor microevent caused the market to price these stocks below their value.\nGraham felt strongly that these stocks, priced “unjustifiably low,” were\nattractive purchases.\nGraham’s conviction rested on certain assumptions. First, he believed that the market frequently mispriced stocks, usually because of the\nhuman emotions of fear and greed. At the height of optimism, greed\nmoved stocks beyond their intrinsic value, creating an overpriced market. At other times, fear moved prices below intrinsic value, creating an\nundervalued market. His second assumption was based on the statistical\nphenomenon known as “reversion to the mean,” although he did not use\nthat term. More eloquently, he quoted the poet Horace: “Many shall be\nrestored that now are fallen, and many shall fall that now are in honor.”\nHowever stated, by statistician or poet, Graham believed that an investor\ncould profit from the corrective forces of an inefficient market.\nPHILIP FISHER\nWhile Graham was writing Security Analysis, Philip Fisher was beginning his career as an investment counselor. After graduating from Stanford’s Graduate School of Business Administration, Fisher began work as\nan analyst at the Anglo London & Paris National Bank in San Francisco.\nIn less than two years, he was made head of the bank’s statistical department. It was from this perch that he witnessed the 1929 stock market\ncrash. After a brief and unproductive career with a local brokerage\nhouse, Fisher decided to start his own investment counseling firm. On\nMarch 1, 1931, Fisher & Company began soliciting clients.\nStarting an investment counseling firm in the early 1930s might have\nappeared foolhardy, but Fisher figured he had two advantages. First, any\ninvestors who had any money left after the crash were probably very unhappy with their existing broker. Second, in the midst of the Great Depression, businesspeople had plenty of time to sit and talk with Fisher.\nAt Stanford, one of Fisher’s business classes had required him to accompany his professor on periodic visits to companies in the San Francisco area. The professor would get the business managers to talk about\ntheir operations, and often helped them solve an immediate problem.\nDriving back to Stanford, Fisher and his professor would recap what they\nobserved about the companies and managers they visited. “That hour\neach week,” Fisher said, “was the most useful training I ever received.”5\nFrom these experiences, Fisher came to believe that people could\nmake superior profits by (1) investing in companies with above-average\npotential and (2) aligning themselves with the most capable management. To isolate these exceptional companies, Fisher developed a point\nsystem that qualified a company by the characteristics of its business and\nits management.\nAs to the first—companies with above-average potential—the characteristic that most impressed Fisher was a company’s ability to grow\nsales over the years at rates greater than the industry average.6 That\ngrowth, in turn, usually was a combination of two factors: a significant\ncommitment to research and development, and an effective sales organization. A company could develop outstanding products and services but\nunless they were “expertly merchandised,” the research and development effort would never translate into revenues.\nIn Fisher’s view, however, market potential alone is only half the\nstory; the other half is consistent profits. “All the sales growth in\nthe world won’t produce the right type of investment vehicle if, over\nthe years, profits do not grow correspondingly,” he said.7 Accordingly,\nFisher examined a company’s profit margins, its dedication to maintaining and improving those margins and, finally, its cost analysis and\naccounting controls.\nNo company, said Fisher, will be able to sustain its profitability unless it is able to break down the costs of doing business while simultaneously understanding the cost of each step in the manufacturing process.\nTo do so, he explained, a company must instill adequate accounting\ncontrols and cost analysis. This cost information, Fisher noted, enables a\ncompany to direct its resources to those products or services with the\nhighest economic potential. Furthermore, accounting controls will help\nidentify snags in a company’s operations. These snags, or inefficiencies,\nact as an early warning device aimed at protecting the company’s overall profitability.\nFisher’s sensitivity about a company’s profitability was linked with\nanother concern: a company’s ability to grow in the future without requiring equity financing. If a company is able to grow only by selling\nstocks, he said, the larger number of shares outstanding will cancel out\nany benefit that stockholders might realize from the company’s growth.\nhe explained, is to uncover as much about a company as possible from\nthose individuals who are familiar with the company. Fisher admitted\nthis was a catchall inquiry that he called “scuttlebutt.” Today we might\ncall it the business grapevine. If handled properly, Fisher claimed, scuttlebutt could provide the investor with substantial clues to identify outstanding investments.\nFisher’s scuttlebutt investigation led him to interview as many\nsources as possible. He talked with customers and vendors. He sought\nout former employees as well as consultants who had worked for the\ncompany. He contacted research scientists in universities, government\nemployees, and trade association executives. He also interviewed competitors. Although executives may sometimes hesitate to disclose too\nmuch about their own company, Fisher found that they never lack an\nopinion about their competitors.\nMost investors are unwilling to commit the time and energy Fisher\nfelt was necessary for understanding a company. Developing a scuttlebutt network and arranging interviews are time consuming; replicating\nthe scuttlebutt process for each company under consideration can be\nexhausting. Fisher found a simple way to reduce his workload—he reduced the number of companies he owned. He always said he would\nrather own a few outstanding companies than a large number of average\nbusinesses. Generally, his portfolios included fewer than ten companies,\nand often three to four companies represented 75 percent of his entire\nequity portfolio.\nFisher believed that, to be successful, investors needed to do just a few\nthings well. One was investing only in companies that were within their\ncircle of competence. Fisher himself made that mistake in the beginning.\n“I began investing outside the industries which I believed I thoroughly\nunderstood, in completely different spheres of activity; situations where I\ndid not have comparable background knowledge.”8\nJOHN BURR WILLIAMS\nJohn Burr Williams graduated from Harvard University in 1923 and\nwent on to Harvard Business School, where he got his first taste of economic forecasting and security analysis. After Harvard, he worked as a\nsecurity analyst at two well-known Wall Street firms. He was there\nthrough the heady days of the 1920s and the disastrous crash of 1929 and\nits aftermath. That experience convinced him that to be a good investor,\none also needs to be a good economist.9\nSo, in 1932 at the age of 30 and already a good investor, he enrolled\nin Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Working from a\nfirm belief that what happened in the economy could affect the value of\nstocks, he had decided to earn an advanced degree in economics.\nWhen it came time to choose a topic for his doctoral dissertation,\nWilliams asked advice from Joseph Schumpeter, the noted Austrian\neconomist best known for his theory of creative destruction, who was\nthen a member of the economics faculty. Schumpeter suggested that\nWilliams look at the “intrinsic value of a common stock,” saying it\nwould fit Williams’s background and experience. Williams later commented that perhaps Schumpeter had a more cynical motive: The\ntopic would keep Williams from “running afoul” of the rest of the\nfaculty, “none of whom would want to challenge my own ideas on investments.”10 Nonetheless, Schumpeter’s suggestion was the impetus\nfor Williams’s famous doctoral dissertation, which, as The Theory\nof Investment Value, has inf luenced financial analysts and investors\never since.\nWilliams finished writing his dissertation in 1937. Even though he\nhad not yet defended it—and to the great indignation of several professors—he submitted the work to Macmillan for publication. Macmillan\ndeclined. So did McGraw-Hill. Both decided that the book had too\nmany algebraic symbols. Finally, in 1938, Williams found a publisher in\nHarvard University Press, but only after he agreed to pay part of the\nprinting cost. Two years later, Williams took his oral exam and, after\nsome intense arguments over the causes of the Great Depression, passed.\nThe Theory of Investment Value is a genuine classic. For sixty\nyears, it has served as the foundation on which many famous economists—Eugene Fama, Harry Markowitz, and Franco Modigliani, to\nname a few—have based their own work. Warren Buffett calls it one of\nthe most important investment books ever written.\nWilliams’s theory, known today as the dividend discount model, or\ndiscounted net cash-f low analysis, provides a way to put a value on a\nstock or a bond. Like many important ideas, it can be reduced to a very\nsimple precept: To know what a security is worth today, estimate all the\ncash it will earn over its lifetime and then discount that total back to a\npresent value. It is the underlying methodology that Warren Buffett\nuses to evaluate stocks and companies.\nBuffett condensed Williams’s theory as: “The value of a business is\ndetermined by the net cash f lows expected to occur over the life of the\nbusiness discounted at an appropriate interest rate.” Williams described\nit this way: “A cow for her milk; a hen for her eggs; and a stock, by\nheck, for her dividends.”11\nWilliams’s model is a two-step process. First it measures cash f lows\nto determine a company’s current and future worth. How to estimate\ncash f lows? One quick measure is dividends paid to shareholders. For\ncompanies that do not distribute dividends, Williams believed that in\ntheory all retained earnings should eventually turn into dividends.\nOnce a company reaches its mature stage, it would not need to reinvest\nits earnings for growth so the management could start distributing the\nearnings in the form of dividends. Williams wrote, “If earnings not\npaid out in dividends are all successfully reinvested, then these earnings\nshould produce dividends later; if not, then they are money lost. In\nshort, a stock is worth only what you can get out of it.”12\nThe second step is to discount those estimated cash f lows, to allow\nfor some uncertainty. We can never be exactly sure what a company will\ndo, how its products will sell, or what management will do or not do to\nimprove the business. There is always an element of risk, particularly for\nstocks, even though Williams’s theory applies equally well to bonds.\nWhat, then, should we use as a discount rate? Williams himself is\nnot explicit on this point, apparently believing his readers could determine for themselves what would be appropriate. Buffett’s measuring\nstick is very straightforward: He uses either the interest rate for longterm (meaning ten-year) U.S. bonds, or when interest rates are very low,\nhe uses the average cumulative rate of return of the overall stock market.\nBy using what amounts to a risk-free rate, Buffett has modified\nWilliams’s original thesis. Because he limits his purchases to those with\nBen Graham’s margin of safety, Buffett ensures that the risk is covered\nin the transaction itself, and therefore he believes that using a risk-free\nrate for discounting is appropriate.\nPeter Bernstein, in his book Capital Ideas, writes that Graham’s\nsystem is a set of rules, whereas Williams’s dividend discount model is a\ntheory; but “both approaches end up recommending the same kinds of\nstocks for purchase.”13\nWarren Buffett has used both, with stellar success.\nCHARLES MUNGER\nWhen Warren Buffett began his investment partnership in Omaha in\n1956, he had just over $100,000 in capital to work with. One early task,\ntherefore, was to persuade additional investors to sign on. He was making his usual careful, detailed pitch to neighbors Dr. and Mrs. Edwin\nDavis, when suddenly Dr. Davis interrupted him and abruptly announced they’d give him $100,000. When Buffett asked why, Davis\nreplied, “Because you remind me of Charlie Munger.14\nCharlie who?\nEven though both men grew up in Omaha and had many acquaintances in common, they did not actually meet until 1959. By that time,\nMunger had moved to southern California, but he returned to Omaha\nfor a visit when his father died. Dr. Davis decided it was time the two\nyoung men met and brought them together at a dinner in a local restaurant. It was the beginning of an extraordinary partnership.\nMunger, the son of a lawyer and grandson of a federal judge, had established a successful law practice in the Los Angeles area, but his interest in the stock market was already strong. At that first dinner, the two\nyoung men found much to talk about, including securities. From then\non, they communicated often, with Buffett frequently urging Munger\nto quit law and to concentrate on investing. For a while, he did both. In\n1962, he formed an investment partnership much like Buffett’s, while\nmaintaining his law practice. Three very successful years later, he left\nthe law altogether, although to this day he has an office in the firm that\nbears his name.\nMunger’s investment partnership in Los Angeles, and Buffett’s in\nOmaha, were similar in approach; both sought to purchase some discount to underlying value. (They also enjoyed similar results, both of\nthem outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average by impressive\nmargins.) It is not surprising, then, that they bought some of the same\nstocks. Munger, like Buffett, began buying shares of Blue Chip Stamps in\nthe late 1960s, and eventually he became chairman of its board. When\nBerkshire and Blue Chip Stamps merged in 1978, he became Berkshire’s\nvice chairman, a position he still holds.\nThe working relationship between Munger and Buffett was not\nformalized in an official partnership agreement, but it has evolved over\nthe years into something perhaps even closer, more symbiotic. Even before Munger joined the Berkshire board, the two made many investment decisions together, often conferring daily; gradually their business\naffairs became more and more interlinked.\nToday Munger continues as vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway\nand also serves as chairman of Wesco Financial, which is 80 percent\nowned by Berkshire and holds many of the same investments. In every\nway, he functions as Buffett’s acknowledged comanaging partner and\nalter ego. To get a sense of how closely the two are aligned, we have\nonly to count the number of times Buffett reports “Charlie and I” did\nthis, or decided that, or believe this, or looked into that, or think this—\nalmost as if “Charlie-and-I” were the name of one person.\nTo their working relationship, Munger brought not only financial\nacumen but the foundation of business law. He also brought an intellectual perspective that is quite different from Buffett’s. Munger is passionately interested in many areas of knowledge—science, history,\nphilosophy, psychology, mathematics—and believes that each of those\nfields holds important concepts that thoughtful people can, and should,\napply to all their endeavors, including investment decisions. He calls\nthem “the big ideas,” and they are the core of his well-known notion\nof “latticework of mental models” for investors.15\nAll these threads together—financial knowledge, background in\nthe law, and appreciation of lessons from other disciplines—produced\nin Munger a somewhat different investment philosophy from that of\nBuffett. Whereas Buffett was still searching for opportunities at bargain prices, Munger believed in paying a fair price for quality companies. He can be very persuasive.\nIt’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than\na fair company at a wonderful price.\nIt was Munger who convinced Buffett that paying three times\nbook value for See’s Candy was actually a good deal. That was the beginning of a plate-tectonic shift in\nBuffett’s thinking, and he happily acknowledges that it was Charlie\nwho pushed him in a new direction. Both would quickly add that\nwhen you find a quality company that also happens to be available at a\ndiscounted price, then you’ve struck oil—or, in Berkshire’s case, the\nnext best thing: Coca-Cola.\nOne reason Buffett and Munger fit so well is that both men possess\nan uncompromising attitude toward commonsense business principles.\nLike Buffett, who endured poor returns in the insurance industry and\nfor a time refused to write policies, Charlie, in his function as CEO of\nWesco, refused to make loans when confronted with an unruly savings\nand loan industry. Both exhibit managerial qualities necessary to run\nhigh-quality businesses. Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders are blessed in\nhaving managing partners who look after their interest and help them\nmake money in all economic environments. With Buffett’s policy on\nmandatory retirement—he does not believe in it—Berkshire’s shareholders will continue to benefit not from one mind but two long into the\nfuture.\nA BLENDING OF INFLUENCES\nShortly after Graham’s death in 1976, Buffett became the designated\nsteward of Graham’s value approach to investing. Indeed, Buffett’s name\nbecame synonymous with value investing. It is easy to see why. He was\nthe most famous of Graham’s dedicated students, and Buffett never\nmissed an opportunity to acknowledge the intellectual debt he owed to\nGraham. Even today, Buffett considers Graham to be the one individual, after his father, who had the most inf luence on his investment life.17\nHow, then, does Buffett reconcile his intellectual indebtedness to\nGraham with stock purchases like the Washington Post Company (1973)\nand the Coca-Cola Company (1988)? Neither passed Graham’s strict\nfinancial test for purchase, yet Buffett made significant investments\nin both.\nAs early as 1965, Buffett was becoming aware that Graham’s strategy\nof buying cheap stocks was not ideal.18 Following his mentor’s approach\nof searching for companies that were selling for less than their net working capital, Buffett bought some genuine losers. Several companies that\nhe had bought at a cheap price (hence they met Graham’s test for purchase) were cheap because their underlying businesses were suffering.\nFrom his earliest investment mistakes, Buffett began moving away\nfrom Graham’s strict teachings. “I evolved,” he admitted, “but I didn’t\ngo from ape to human or human to ape in a nice even manner.”19 He\nwas beginning to appreciate the qualitative nature of certain companies,\ncompared with the quantitative aspects of others. Despite that, however,\nhe still found himself searching for bargains, sometimes with horrible results. “My punishment,” he confessed, “was an education in the economics of short-line farm implementation manufacturers (Dempster Mill\nManufacturing), third-place department stores (Hochschild-Kohn), and\nNew England textile manufacturers (Berkshire Hathaway).”20 Buffett’s\nevolution was delayed, he admitted, because what Graham taught him\nwas so valuable.\nWhen evaluating stocks, Graham did not think about the specifics of\nthe businesses. Nor did he ponder the capabilities of management. He\nlimited his research investigation to corporate filings and annual reports.\nIf there was a mathematical probability of making money because the\nshare price was less than the assets of the company, Graham purchased\nthe company, regardless of its business or its management. To increase\nthe probability of success, he purchased as many of these statistical equations as possible.\nIf Graham’s teachings were limited to these precepts, Buffett would\nhave had little regard for him. But the margin-of-safety theory that\nGraham emphasized was so important to Buffett that he could overlook\nall other current weaknesses of Graham’s methodology. Even today,\nBuffett continues to embrace Graham’s primary idea, the theory of\nmargin of safety. “Forty-two years after reading that,” Buffett noted,\n“I still think those are the three right words.”21 The key lesson that\nBuffett took from Graham was that successful investing involved purchasing stocks when their market price was at a significant discount to\nthe underlying business value.\nIn addition to the margin-of-safety theory, which became the\nintellectual framework of Buffett’s thinking, Graham helped Buffett\nappreciate the folly of following stock market f luctuations. Stocks have\nan investment characteristic and a speculative characteristic, Graham\ntaught, and the speculative characteristics are a consequence of people’s\nfear and greed. These emotions, present in most investors, cause stock\nprices to gyrate far above and, more important, far below a company’s\nintrinsic value, thus presenting a margin of safety. Graham taught Buffett that if he could insulate himself from the emotional whirlwinds of\nthe stock market, he had an opportunity to exploit the irrational behavior of other investors, who purchased stocks based on emotion, not logic.\nFrom Graham, Buffett learned how to think independently. If he\nreached a logical conclusion based on sound judgment, Graham counseled Buffett, he should not be dissuaded just because others disagree.\n“You are neither right or wrong because the crowd disagrees with you,”\nhe wrote. “You are right because your data and reasoning are right.”22\nPhil Fisher in many ways was the exact opposite of Ben Graham.\nFisher believed that to make sound decisions, investors needed to become\nfully informed about a business. That meant they needed to investigate\nall aspects of the company. They needed to look beyond the numbers and\nlearn about the business itself because that information mattered a great\ndeal. They also needed to study the attributes of the company’s management, for management’s abilities could affect the value of the underlying\nbusiness. They should learn as much as they could about the industry in\nwhich the company operated, and about its competitors. Every source of\ninformation should be exploited.\nAppearing on the PBS show Money World in 1993, Buffett\nwas asked what investment advice he would give a money\nmanager just starting out. “I’d tell him to do exactly what I did\n40-odd years ago, which is to learn about every company in\nthe United States that has publicly traded securities.”\nModerator Adam Smith protested, “But there’s 27,000\npublic companies.”\n“Well,” said Buffett, “start with the A’s.”\nFrom Fisher, Buffett learned the value of scuttlebutt. Throughout\nthe years, Buffett has developed an extensive network of contacts who\nassist him in evaluating businesses.\nFinally, Fisher taught Buffett the benefits of focusing on just a few\ninvestments. He believed that it was a mistake to teach investors that putting their eggs in several baskets reduces risk. The danger in purchasing\ntoo many stocks, he felt, is that it becomes impossible to watch all the\neggs in all the baskets. In his view, buying shares in a company without\ntaking the time to develop a thorough understanding of the business was\nfar more risky than having limited diversification.\nJohn Burr Williams provided Buffett with a methodology for calculating the intrinsic value of a business, which is a cornerstone of his\ninvesting approach.\nThe differences between Graham and Fisher are apparent. Graham,\nthe quantitative analyst, emphasized only those factors that could be measured: fixed assets, current earnings, and dividends. His investigative research was limited to corporate filings and annual reports. He spent no\ntime interviewing customers, competitors, or managers.\nFisher’s approach was the antithesis of Graham. Fisher, the qualitative analyst, emphasized those factors that he believed increased the value\nof a company: principally, future prospects and management capability.\nWhereas Graham was interested in purchasing only cheap stocks, Fisher\nwas interested in purchasing companies that had the potential to increase\ntheir intrinsic value over the long term. He would go to great lengths,\nincluding conducting extensive interviews, to uncover bits of information that might improve his selection process.\nAlthough Graham’s and Fisher’s investment approach differ, notes\nBuffett, they “parallel in the investment world.”24 Taking the liberty of\nrephrasing, I would say that instead of paralleling, in Warren Buffett\nthey dovetail: His investment approach combines qualitative understanding of the business and its management (as taught by Fisher) and a\nquantitative understanding of price and value (as taught by Graham).\nWarren Buffett once said, “I’m 15 percent Fisher and 85 percent\nBenjamin Graham.”25 That remark has been widely quoted, but it is important to remember that it was made in 1969. In the intervening years,\nBuffett has made a gradual but definite shift toward Fisher’s philosophy\nof buying a select few good businesses and owning those businesses for\nseveral years. My hunch is that if he were to make a similar statement\ntoday, the balance would come pretty close to 50/50.\nWithout question, it was Charlie Munger who was most responsible for moving Buffett toward Fisher’s thinking.\nIn a real sense, Munger is the active embodiment of Fisher’s qualitative theories. From the start, Charlie had a keen appreciation of the\nvalue of a better business, and the wisdom of paying a reasonable price\nfor it. Through their years together, Charlie has continued to preach\nthe wisdom of paying up for a good business.\nIn one important respect, however, Munger is also the present-day\necho of Ben Graham. Years earlier, Graham had taught Buffett the twofold significance of emotion in investing—the mistakes it triggers for\nthose who base irrational decisions on it, and the opportunities it thus\ncreates for those who can avoid falling into the same traps. Munger,\nthrough his readings in psychology, has continued to develop that theme.\nHe calls it the psychology of misjudgment,” a notion we look at more\nfully in Chapter 11; and through persistent emphasis, he keeps it an integral part of Berkshire’s decision making. It is one of his most important\ncontributions.\nBuffett’s dedication to Ben Graham, Phil Fisher, John Burr Williams,\nand Charlie Munger is understandable. Graham gave Buffett the intellectual basis for investing, the margin of safety, and helped Buffett learn\nhow to master his emotions to take advantage of market f luctuations.\nFisher gave Buffett an updated, workable methodology that enabled him\nto identify good long-term investments and manage a portfolio over the\nlong term, and taught the value of focusing on just a few good companies. Williams gave him a mathematical model for calculating true\nvalue. Munger helped Buffett appreciate the economic returns that come\nfrom buying and owning great businesses. The frequent confusion surrounding Buffett’s investment actions is easily understood when we acknowledge that Buffett is the synthesis of all four men.\n“It is not enough to have good intelligence,” Descartes wrote; “the\nprincipal thing is to apply it well.” It is the application that separates\nBuffett from other investment managers. Many of his peers are highly\nintelligent, disciplined, and dedicated. Buffett stands above them all because of his formidable ability to integrate the strategies of the four\nwise men into a single cohesive approach.",
    "Buying a Business": "Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., is complex but not complicated. It owns\n(at the moment) just shy of 100 separate businesses—the insurance\ncompanies described in the previous chapter, and a wide variety\nof noninsurance businesses acquired through the income stream from\nthe insurance operation. Using that same cash stream, it also purchases\nbonds and stocks of publicly traded companies. Running through it all is\nWarren Buffett’s down-to-earth way of looking at a business: whether\nit’s one he’s considering buying in its entirety or one he’s evaluating for\nstock purchase.\nThere is no fundamental difference, Buffett believes, between the\ntwo. Both make him an owner of the business, and therefore both decisions should, in his view, spring from this owner’s point of view. This is\nthe single most important thing to understand about Buffett’s investment\napproach: Buying stocks means buying a business and requires the same\ndiscipline. In fact, it has always been Buffett’s preference to directly own\na company, for it permits him to inf luence what he considers the most\ncritical issue in a business: capital allocation. But when stocks represent a\nbetter value, his choice is to own a portion of a company by purchasing\nits common stock.\nIn either case, Buffett follows the same strategy: He looks for companies he understands, with consistent earnings history and favorable\nlong-term prospects, showing good return on equity with little debt,\nthat are operated by honest and competent people, and, importantly, are\navailable at attractive prices. This owner-oriented way of looking at potential investments is bedrock to Buffett’s approach.\nAll we want is to be in businesses that we understand, run by\npeople whom we like, and priced attractively relative to their\nfuture prospects.\nBecause he operates from this owner’s perspective, wherein buying\nstock is the same as buying companies, it is also true that buying companies is the same as buying stock. The same principles apply in both\ncases, and therefore both hold important lessons for us.\nThose principles are described in some detail in Chapters 5 through\n8. Collectively, they make up what I have called the “Warren Buffett\nWay,” and they are applied, almost subconsciously, every time he considers buying shares of a company, or acquiring the entire company. In this\nchapter, we take a brief background tour of some of these purchases, so\nthat we may better understand the lessons they offer.\nA MOSAIC OF MANY BUSINESSES\nBerkshire Hathaway, Inc., as it exists today, is best understood as a\nholding company. In addition to the insurance companies, it also owns\na newspaper, a candy company, an ice cream/hamburger chain, an encyclopedia publisher, several furniture stores, a maker of Western boots,\njewelry stores, a supplier of custom picture framing material, a paint\ncompany, a company that manufactures and distributes uniforms, a vacuum cleaner business, a public utility, a couple of shoe companies, and\na household name in underwear—among others.\nSome of these companies, particularly the more recent acquisitions,\nare jewels that Buffett found in a typically Buffett-like way: He advertised for them in the Berkshire Hathaway annual reports.\nHis criteria are straightforward: a simple, understandable business\nwith consistent earning power, good return on equity, little debt, and\ngood management in place. He is interested in companies in the $5 billion to $20 billion range, the larger the better. He is not interested in\nturnarounds, hostile takeovers, or tentative situations where no asking\nprice has been determined. He promises complete confidentiality and a\nquick response.\nIn Berkshire Hathaway’s annual reports and in remarks to shareholders, he has often described his acquisition strategy this way: “It’s\nvery scientific. Charlie and I just sit around and wait for the phone to\nring. Sometimes it’s a wrong number.”1\nThe strategy works. Through this public announcement, and also\nthrough referrals from managers of current Berkshire companies, Buffett has acquired an amazing string of successful businesses. Some of\nthem have been Berkshire companies for decades, and their stories have\nbecome part of the Buffett lore.\nSee’s Candy Shops, for example, has been a Berkshire subsidiary\nsince 1972. It is noteworthy because it represents the first time Buffett\nmoved away from Ben Graham’s dictum to buy only undervalued companies. The net purchase price—$30 million—was three times book\nvalue. Without doubt, it was a good decision. In 2003 alone, See’s pretax earnings were $59 million—almost exactly twice the original purchase price.\nAt Berkshire’s annual meeting in 1997, 25 years after the See’s purchase, Charlie Munger recalled, “It was the first time we paid for quality.” To which Buffett added, “If we hadn’t bought See’s, we wouldn’t\nhave bought Coke.”3 Later on in this chapter, the full significance of that\ncomment becomes apparent.\nAnother company well known to Berkshire followers is Nebraska\nFurniture Mart. This enormous retail operation began in Omaha,\nBuffett’s hometown, in 1937 when a Russian immigrant named Rose\nBlumkin, who had been selling furniture from her basement, put up\n$500 to open a small store. In 1983, Buffett paid Mrs. B, as she was\nuniversally known, $55 million for 80 percent of her store.\nToday the Nebraska Furniture Mart, which comprises three retail\nunits totaling 1.2 million square feet on one large piece of real estate,\nsells more home furnishings than any other store in the country. Running a close second is the second Mart, opened in 2002 in Kansas City. In\nhis 2003 letter to shareholders, Buffett linked the success of this 450,000square-foot operation to the legendary Mrs. B., who was still at work\nuntil the year she died at the age of 104. “One piece of wisdom she imparted,” Buffett wrote, “was ‘if you have the lowest price, customers will\nfind you at the bottom of a river.’ Our store serving greater Kansas City,\nwhich is located in one of the area’s more sparsely populated parts, has\nproved Mrs. B’s point. Though we have more than 25 acres of parking,\nthe lot has at times overf lowed.”4\nIn January 1986, Buffett paid $315 million in cash for the Scott &\nFetzer Company, a conglomerate of twenty-one separate companies, including the makers of Kirby vacuum cleaners and World Book encyclopedia. It was one of Berkshire’s largest business acquisitions up to that\npoint, and has since exceeded Buffett’s own optimistic expectations. It is\na model of an organization that creates a large return on equity with\nvery little debt—and that is one of Buffett’s favorite traits. In fact, he\ncalculates that Scott Fetzer’s return on equity would easily place it\namong the top 1 percent of the Fortune 500.\nScott Fetzer’s various companies make a range of rather specialized\n(some would say boring) industrial products, but what they really make\nis money for Berkshire Hathaway. Since Buffett bought it, Scott Fetzer\nhas distributed over 100 percent of its earnings back to Berkshire while\nsimultaneously increasing its own earnings.\nIn recent years, Warren Buffett has turned more and more of his attention to buying companies instead of shares. The story of how Buffett\ncame to acquire these diverse businesses is interesting in itself. Perhaps\nmore to the point, the stories collectively give us valuable insight into\nBuffett’s way of looking at companies. In this chapter, we have space\nfor an abbreviated visit to just three of these acquisitions, but that is by\nno means all. To illustrate the wide range of industries within Berkshire, here are a few examples of recent acquisitions:\n• Fruit of the Loom, which produces one-third of the men’s and\nboys’ underwear sold in the United States. Purchased in 2002 for\n$835 million, which, after accounting for the earned interest on\nassumed debt, was a net of $730 million.\n• Garan, which makes children’s clothing, including the popular\nGaranimals line. Purchased in 2002 for $270 million.\n• MiTek, which produces structural hardware for the building industry. Purchased in 2001 for $400 million. An interesting aspect of this deal is that Berkshire now owns only 90 percent of\nthe company. The other 10 percent is owned by 55 managers\nwho love their company and wanted to be part owners; this entrepreneurial spirit among management is one of the qualities\nBuffett looks for.\nLarson-Juhl, the leading supplier of framing materials to custom\nframing shops. Purchased in 2001 for $225 million.\nCORT Business Services, which leases quality furniture to offices\nand corporate-owned apartments. Purchased in 2000 for $467\nmillion, including $83 million of debt.\nBen Bridge Jeweler, a West Coast chain owned and operated by\nthe same family for four generations. A requirement of the purchase was that the Bridge family remain to manage the company.\nPurchased in 2000 for a price not disclosed publicly.\nJustin Industries, which makes Western boots ( Justin, Tony Lama,\nand other brands) and, under the Acme brand name, bricks. Purchased in 2000 for $600 million.\nBenjamin Moore, which has been making paint for 121 years.\nPurchased in 2000 for $1 billion.\nShaw Industries, the largest manufacturer of carpeting in the\nworld. Purchased 87 percent of the company in 2000 and the remainder in early 2002, for a total of $2 billion. Currently, Shaw is,\nexcept for insurance, Berkshire’s largest business, with 2003 earnings of $436 million.\nIn 1966, James Clayton, the son of a Tennessee sharecropper, started a\nmobile home business with $25,000 of borrowed money. Within four\nyears, Clayton Homes was selling 700 units annually. Clayton is now\none of the largest makers of manufactured homes in the United States,\nwith about $1.2 billion in sales in 2003. Home models range from\nmodest (500 square feet, priced at $10,000) to luxury ($100,000 for\n1,500 square feet, with hardwood f loors, stainless steel appliances, and\nisland kitchens).\nClayton has about 976 retailers in the United States, including 302\ncompany-owned stores, 86 company-owned community sales offices,\nand 588 manufactured housing communities in 33 states. It also owns\nand operates financing, loan-servicing, and insurance subsidiaries. The\ncompany went public in 1983, and Berkshire Hathaway acquired it in\nAugust 2003 for $1.7 billion.\nJames Clayton gained his experience and education the hard way.\nDetermined to pull himself out of the backbreaking work his parents\nendured (his father picked cotton and his mother worked in a shirt\nfactory), Clayton financed his education at the University of Tennessee\nby playing guitar on the radio. He eventually became a part-time host\non Startime, a weekly variety program on Knoxville TV and sang\nalong with people like Dolly Parton. Then, while in college, he started\na used car business with his fraternity brothers but the business went\nbankrupt in 1961 when the bank called his loan. “My parents thought\nfor sure that we were going to jail and I made a pact with myself that I\nhaven’t violated: I was never going to be vulnerable to a bank again.”5\nThe acquisition of Clayton Homes is a typical Buffett story—\nmeaning that it is atypical compared with the rest of the business world.\nThe first aspect of the story is that Buffett had some hands-on experience with the industry. In 2002, Berkshire had purchased junk\nbonds from Oakwood Homes, another mobile home manufacturer. As\nBuffett has freely admitted, at the time he was not fully aware of the\n“atrocious consumer financing practices” that were common in the\nindustry. “But I learned,” he added. “Oakwood rather promptly went\nbankrupt.”6\nFast forward to February 2003. Al Auxier, a professor of finance at\nthe University of Tennessee, brought a group of MBA students to\nOmaha to meet with Buffett for what Buffett describes as “two hours of\ngive-and-take.” It was the fifth time Auxier had made the trip, and it had\nbecome traditional for the visiting students to bring a thank-you gift for\nBuffett. This time, the gift was the autobiography of James Clayton, who\nhad located his company in Knoxville, home of his alma mater.\nAfter he finished reading the book, Buffett phoned James Clayton’s\nson Kevin, who is now CEO. “As I talked with Kevin, it became clear\nthat he was both able and a straight-shooter. Soon thereafter, I made an\noffer for the business based solely on Jim’s book, my evaluation of\nKevin, the public financials of Clayton and what I had learned from the\nOakwood experience.”7 Two weeks later, Berkshire announced its acquisition of Clayton Homes. “I made the deal over the phone,” Buffett\nsaid, “without ever seeing it.”8\nIn the fall of 2003, Buffett was invited to attend the University of\nTennessee’s MBA Symposium. He recounted the Clayton story, and\nthen presented all the students who had started the ball rolling with\nhonorary PhDs (for Phenomenal, hard-working Dealmaker) from the\nUniversity of Berkshire Hathaway. Each student was also given one class\nB share of Berkshire, and their teacher, Al Auxier, was presented with an\nA share.\nIn 1894, Robert McLane, escaping the post-Civil War poverty of South\nCarolina, moved to Cameron, Texas, and started a small grocery store.\nOver the years, he developed it into a wholesale grocery and distribution\nbusiness. His son, Robert D. McLane, known by his middle name of\nDrayton, joined the company in 1921. Drayton’s son, Drayton Jr., began\nworking in the family business at the age of nine, and spent many teenage\nSaturdays sweeping f loors in the warehouse. After college, he joined the\ncompany full time.\nEventually Drayton Jr. convinced his father to move the company\nclose to an interstate highway and then in 1962 to automate the business\nwith computers. In 1990, he sold the company to his tennis pal Sam Walton, and McLane became a Wal-Mart subsidiary, supplying Wal-Mart\nand Sam’s Club stores, as well as convenience stores and fast-food restaurants across the nation with everything from peanuts to pepperoni.\nBy 2003, McLane had become the largest distributor in the United\nStates to corner and convenience stores. McLane’s innovative software\nsystems for pricing, freight, delivery, and point-of-sales processing and\nits excellent delivery service had made the company a lean and efficient\nfull-service delivery company.\nAn efficient, well-run company built on strong principles and showing consistent profitability is just what Warren Buffett likes to see. In\nMay 2003, Berkshire announced it had acquired McLane for $1.45 billion in cash, and assumed an additional $1.2 billion in liabilities.\nThe acquisition positioned McLane for even greater growth, as it\nfreed the company to pursue distribution contracts with supermarket\nchains and with Wal-Mart competitors, such as Target and Dollar General. “In the past some retailers had shunned McLane,” wrote Buffett in\nhis 2003 shareholder letter, “because it was owned by their major competitor. But Grady Rosier, McLane’s superb CEO, has already landed\nsome of these accounts—he was in full stride the day the deal closed—\nand more will come.”9\nIn 1980, Doris Christopher, a former teacher of home economics and a\nstay-at-home mom, was looking for part-time work with f lexible hours\nthat would add to the family income but still allow her time with her\ntwo young daughters. She decided to leverage what she knew—cooking\nand teaching—and that led her to the idea of selling kitchenware with inhome demonstrations. So she borrowed $3,000 against her life insurance\npolicy, went shopping at the wholesale mart and bought $175 worth of\nproducts she admired, then asked a friend to host a demonstration party.\nChristopher was a nervous wreck before the first party, but it was\na resounding success. Not only did everyone have a great time, several\nguests suggested they’d like to host a party themselves. That was the\nbeginning of the Pampered Chef, a company that markets gourmet\nkitchenware through direct sales and in-home parties.\nThe 34-year-old Christopher, who had no business background,\nstarted the company in the basement of her Chicago home with the\n$3,000 loan. The first year, working with her husband, she had sales of\n$50,000 and never looked back. In 1994, the Pampered Chef was\namong Inc. magazine’s 500 fastest-growing privately held companies in\nthe United States, and Christopher has been recognized by Working\nWoman magazine as one of the top 500 women business owners.\nDoris Christopher started her business with a passionate belief that\nsitting down together at mealtime brings families together in a way that\nfew other experiences can match. That philosophy has shaped and\nguided the Pampered Chef from the beginning, and it is at the core of\nthe sales approach: a friendly, hands-on pitch to housewives that links\nthe quality of family life to the quality of kitchen products.\nMany of the company’s “kitchen consultants,” as they are called, are\nstay-at-home moms, and most of the sales are conducted in their homes\nat “kitchen shows.” These are cooking demonstrations where guests see\nproducts and recipes in action, learn quick and easy food preparation\ntechniques, and receive tips on how to entertain with style and ease. The\nproducts are professional-quality kitchen tools and pantry food items;\nsome 80 percent of the products are exclusive to the company or can\nonly be bought from TPC representatives.\nToday, the Pampered Chef has 950 employees in the United States,\nGermany, the United Kingdom, and Canada, and its products are sold\nby over 71,000 independent consultants during in-home demonstrations. Over one million kitchen shows were held throughout the United\nStates in 2002, producing sales of $730 million. And the only debt the\ncompany has ever incurred is the original $3,000 seed money.\nIn 2002, Doris Christopher realized that in case she either keeled\nover or decided to slow down, the Pampered Chef needed a backup\nplan. So, on the advice of her bankers at Goldman Sachs, she approached\nWarren Buffett. That August, Christopher and her then CEO, Sheila\nO’Connell Cooper, met with Buffett at his headquarters in Omaha. A\nmonth later, Berkshire announced it had bought the company, for a price\nthought to be approximately $900 million.\nRecalling that August meeting, Buffett wrote to Berkshire shareholders, “It took me about ten seconds to decide that these were two\nmanagers with whom I wished to partner, and we promptly made a\ndeal. I’ve been to a TPC party and it’s easy to see why this business is a\nsuccess. The company’s products, in large part proprietary, are wellstyled and highly useful, and the consultants are knowledgeable and enthusiastic. Everyone has a good time.”10\nBuffett is often asked what types of companies he will purchase in the\nfuture. First, he says, I will avoid commodity businesses and managers\nthat I have little confidence in. He has three touchstones: It must be the\ntype of company that he understands, possessing good economics, and\nrun by trustworthy managers. That’s also what he looks for in stocks—\nand for the same reasons.\nINVESTING IN STOCKS\nIt is patently obvious that few of us are in a position to buy whole companies, as Buffett does. Their stories are included in this chapter because\nthey give us such crisp insight into Buffett’s way of thinking.\nThat same chain of thinking also applies to his decisions about buying stocks, and that does present some examples that ordinary mortals\nmight follow. We may not be able to buy shares on the same scale as\nWarren Buffett, but we can profit from watching what he does.\nAt the end of 2003, Berkshire Hathaway’s common stock portfolio\nhad a total market value of more than $35 billion (see Table A.27 in the\nAppendix)—an increase of almost $27 billion from the original purchase prices. In that portfolio, Berkshire Hathaway owns, among others, 200 million shares of Coca-Cola, 96 million shares of the Gillette\nCompany, and 56-plus million shares of Wells Fargo & Company. Soft\ndrinks, razor blades, neighborhood banks—products and services that\nare familiar to us all. Nothing esoteric, nothing high-tech, nothing\nhard to understand. It is one of Buffett’s most strongly held beliefs: It\nmakes no sense to invest in a company or an industry you don’t understand, because you won’t be able to figure out what it’s worth or to\ntrack what it’s doing.\nThe Coca-Cola Company\nCoca-Cola is the world’s largest manufacturer, marketer, and distributor of carbonated soft drink concentrates and syrups. The company’s\nsoft drink product, first sold in the United States in 1886, is now sold in\nmore than 195 countries worldwide.\nBuffett’s relationship with Coca-Cola dates back to his childhood.\nHe had his first Coca-Cola when he was five years old. Soon afterward,\nhe started buying six Cokes for 25 cents from his grandfather’s grocery\nstore and reselling them in his neighborhood for 5 cents each. For the\nnext fifty years, Buffett admits, he observed the phenomenal growth of\nCoca-Cola, but he purchased textile mills, department stores, and windmill and farming equipment manufacturers. Even in 1986, when he formally announced that Cherry Coke would become the official soft\ndrink of Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meetings, Buffett had still not\npurchased a share of Coca-Cola. It was not until two years later, in the\nsummer of 1988, that Buffett purchased his first shares of Coca-Cola.\nThe strength of Coca-Cola is not only its brand-name products, but\nalso its unmatched worldwide distribution system. Today, international\nsales of Coca-Cola products account for 69 percent of the company’s\ntotal sales and 80 percent of its profits. In addition to Coca-Cola Amatil,\nthe company has equity interests in bottlers located in Mexico, South\nAmerica, Southeast Asia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China. In 2003, the\ncompany sold more than 19 billion cases of beverage products.\nThe best business to own, says Buffett, is one that over time can\nemploy large amounts of capital at very high rates of return. This description fits Coca-Cola perfectly. It is easy to understand why Buffett\nconsiders Coca-Cola, the most widely recognized brand name around\nthe world, to be the world’s most valuable franchise.\nBecause of this financial strength, and also because the product is so\nwell known, I use Coca-Cola as the primary example in Chapters 5\nthrough 8, which detail the tenets of the Warren Buffett Way.\nI buy businesses, not stocks, businesses I would be willing to\nown forever.11\nWARREN BUFFETT, 1998\nThe Gillette Company\nGillette is an international consumer products company that manufactures and distributes blades and razors, toiletries and cosmetics, stationery\nproducts, electric shavers, small household appliances, and oral care appliances and products. It has manufacturing operations in 14 countries and\ndistributes its products in over 200 countries and territories. Foreign operations account for over 63 percent of Gillette’s sales and earnings.\nKing C. Gillette founded the company at the turn of the twentieth\ncentury. As a young man, Gillette spent time strategizing how he would\nmake his fortune. A friend suggested that he should invent a product\nthat consumers would use once, throw away, and replace with another.\nWhile working as a salesperson for Crown Cork & Seal, Gillette hit on\nthe idea of a disposable razor blade. In 1903, his f ledgling company\nbegan selling the Gillette safety razor with 25 disposable blades for $5.\nToday, Gillette is the world’s leading manufacturer and distributor\nof blades and razors. Razor blades account for approximately one-third\nof the company’s sales but two-thirds of its profits. Its global share of\nmarket is 72.5 percent, almost six times greater than the nearest competitor. The company has a 70 percent market share in Europe, 80 percent in Latin America. Sales are just beginning to grow in Eastern\nEurope, India, and China. For every one blade that Gillette sells in the\nUnited States, it sells five overseas. In fact, Gillette is so dominant\nworldwide that in many languages its name has become the word for\n“razor blade.”\nBuffett became interested in Gillette in the 1980s. Wall Street observers had begun to see the company as a mature, slow-growing consumer company ripe for a takeover. Profit margins hovered between\n9 percent and 11 percent, return on equity f lattened out with no sign of\nimprovement, and income growth and market value were anemic (see\nFigures 4.1 and 4.2). In short, the company appeared stagnant.\nCEO Colman Mockler fought off four takeover attempts during\nthis time, culminating in a hotly contested battle against Coniston Partners in 1988. Gillette won—barely—but in so doing obligated itself to\nbuy back 19 million shares of Gillette stock at $45 per share. Between\n1986 and 1988, the company replaced $1.5 billion in equity with debt,\nand for a short period Gillette had a negative net worth.\nAt this point Buffett called his friend Joseph Sisco, a member of\nGillette’s board, and proposed that Berkshire invest in the company.\n“Gillette’s business is very much the kind we like,” Buffett said.\n“Charlie and I think we understand the company’s economics and\ntherefore believe we can make a reasonably intelligent guess about its\nfuture.”12 Gillette issued $600 million in convertible preferred stock to\nBerkshire in July 1989 and used the funds to pay down debt. Buffett received a 8.75 percent convertible preferred security with a mandatory\nredemption in ten years and the option to convert into Gillette common at $50 per share, 20 percent higher than the then-current price.\nIn 1989, Buffett joined Gillette’s board of directors. That same year,\nthe company introduced a highly successful new product, the Sensor. It\nwas the beginning of a turnaround. With Sensor sales, Gillette’s prosperity magnified. Earnings per share began growing at a 20 percent annual rate. Pretax margins increased from 12 to 15 percent and return on\nequity reached 40 percent, twice its return in the early 1980s.\nIn February 1991, the company announced a 2-for-1 stock split.\nBerkshire converted its preferred stock and received 12 million common shares or 11 percent of Gillette’s shares outstanding. In less than\ntwo years, Berkshire’s $600 million investment in Gillette had grown\nto $875 million. Buffett’s next step was to calculate the value of those\n12 million shares; in Chapter 8, we’ll see how he went about it.\nGillette’s razor blade business is a prime beneficiary of globalization. Typically, Gillette begins with low-end blades that have lower\nmargins and over time introduces improved shaving systems with higher\nmargins. The company stands to benefit not only from increasing unit\nsales but from steadily improving profit margins as well. Gillette’s future appears bright. “It’s pleasant to go to bed every night,” says Buffett,\n“knowing there are 2.5 billion males in the world who will have to\nshave in the morning.”13\nThe Washington Post Company\nThe Washington Post Company today is a media conglomerate with\noperations in newspaper publishing, television broadcasting, cable television systems, magazine publishing, and the provision of educational\nservices. The newspaper division publishes the Washington Post, the\nEverett (Washington) Herald, and the Gazette Newspapers, a group of\n39 weekly papers. The television broadcasting division owns six television stations located in Detroit, Miami, Orlando, Houston, San Antonio, and Jacksonville, Florida. The cable television systems division\nprovides cable and digital video services to more than 1.3 billion subscribers. The magazine division publishes Newsweek, with domestic\ncirculation of over 3 million and over 600,000 internationally.\nIn addition to the four major divisions, the Washington Post Company owns the Stanley H. Kaplan Educational Centers, a large network\nof schools that prepare students for college admission tests and professional licensing exams. Best known for its original program that helps\nhigh school students do well on Scholastic Aptitude Tests, Kaplan has\naggressively expanded its operations in recent years. It now includes\nafter-school classes for grades K-12, the world’s only accredited online\nlaw school, test-prep materials for engineers and CFAs, and campusbased schools with programs in business, finance, technology, health,\nand other professions. In 2003, Kaplan’s sales totaled $838 million,\nmaking it a significant element in the Post Company.\nThe company owns 28 percent of Cowles Media, which publishes\nthe Minneapolis Star Tribune, several military newspapers, and 50 percent of the Los Angeles-Washington News Service.\nToday, the Washington Post Company is an $8 billion company\ngenerating $3.2 billion in annual sales. Its accomplishments are especially impressive when you consider that seventy years ago, the company was in one business—publishing a newspaper.\nIn 1931, the Washington Post was one of five dailies competing for\nreaders. Two years later, the Post, unable to pay for its newsprint, was\nplaced in receivership. That summer, the company was sold at auction\nto satisfy creditors. Eugene Meyer, a millionaire financier, bought the\npaper for $825,000. For the next two decades, he supported the operation until it turned a profit.\nManagement of the paper passed to Philip Graham, a brilliant\nHarvard-educated lawyer who had married Meyer’s daughter Katherine. In 1954, Phil Graham convinced Eugene Meyer to purchase a rival\nnewspaper, the Times-Herald. Later, Graham purchased Newsweek\nmagazine and two television stations before his tragic death in 1963. It\nis Phil Graham who is credited with transforming the Washington Post\nfrom a single newspaper into a media and communications company.\nAfter Phil Graham’s death, control of the Washington Post passed\nto his wife, Katherine. Although she had no experience managing a\nmajor corporation, she quickly distinguished herself by confronting difficult business issues.\nKatherine Graham realized that to be successful the company would\nneed a decision maker not a caretaker. “I quickly learned that things\ndon’t stand still,” she said. “You have to make decisions.”14 Two decisions that had a pronounced impact on the Washington Post were hiring\nBen Bradlee as managing editor of the newspaper and then inviting\nWarren Buffett to become a director of the company. Bradlee encouraged Katherine Graham to publish the Pentagon Papers and to pursue\nthe Watergate investigation, which earned the Washington Post a reputation for prizewinning journalism. Buffett taught Katherine Graham\nhow to run a successful business.\nBuffett first met Katherine Graham in 1971. At that time, Buffett\nowned stock in the New Yorker. Hearing that the magazine might be\nfor sale, he asked Katherine Graham whether the Washington Post\nwould be interested in purchasing it. Although the sale never materialized, Buffett came away very much impressed with the publisher of\nthe Washington Post.\nThat same year, Katherine Graham decided to take the Washington\nPost public. Two classes of stock were created. Class A common stock\nelected a majority of the board of directors, thus effectively controlling\nthe company. Class A stock was, and still is, held by the Graham family.\nClass B stock elected a minority of the board of directors. In June 1971,\nthe Washington Post issued 1,354,000 shares of class B stock. Remarkably, two days later, despite threats from the federal government, Katherine Graham gave Ben Bradlee permission to publish the Pentagon Papers.\nFor the next two years, while business at the paper was improving,\nthe mood on Wall Street was turning gloomy. In early 1973, the Dow\nJones Industrial Average began to slide. The Washington Post share price\nwas slipping as well; by May, it was down 14 points to $23. That same\nmonth, IBM stock declined over 69 points, gold broke through $100 an\nounce, the Federal Reserve boosted the discount rate to 6 percent, and\nthe Dow fell 18 points—its biggest loss in three years. And all the while,\nWarren Buffett was quietly buying shares in the Washington Post (see\nFigure 4.3). By June, he had purchased 467,150 shares at an average\nprice of $22.75, worth $10,628,000.\nKatherine Graham was initially unnerved at the idea of a nonfamily\nmember owning so much Post stock, even though the stock was noncontrolling. Buffett assured her that Berkshire’s purchase was for investment purposes only. To further reassure her, he offered to give her son\nDon, slated to take over the company someday, a proxy to vote Berkshire’s shares. That clinched it. Katherine Graham responded by inviting Buffett to join the board of directors in 1974 and soon made him\nchairman of the finance committee.\nKatherine Graham died in July 2001, after a fall in which she sustained severe head injuries. Warren Buffett was one of the ushers at her\nfuneral services at Washington’s National Cathedral.\nDonald E. Graham, son of Phil and Katherine, is chairman of\nthe board of the Washington Post Company. Don Graham graduated\nmagna cum laude from Harvard in 1966, having majored in English history and literature. After graduation, he served two years in the army.\nKnowing that he would eventually lead the Washington Post, Graham\ndecided to get better acquainted with the city. He took the unusual path\nof joining the metropolitan police force of Washington, DC, and spent\nfourteen months as a patrolman walking the beat in the ninth precinct.\nIn 1971, Graham went to work at the Washington Post as a Metro reporter. Later, he spent ten months as a reporter for Newsweek at the Los\nAngeles bureau. Graham returned to the Post in 1974 and became the\nassistant managing sports editor. That year, he was added to the company’s board of directors.\nBuffett’s role at the Washington Post is widely documented. He\nhelped Katherine Graham persevere during the labor strikes of the\n1970s, and he also tutored Don Graham in business, helping him understand the role of management and its responsibility to its owners.\n“In finance,” Don Graham says, “he’s the smartest guy I know. I don’t\nknow who is second.”15\nLooking at the story from the reverse side, it’s also clear that the Post\nhas played a major role for Buffett as well. Finance journalist Andrew\nKilpatrick, who has followed Buffett’s career for years, believes that the\nWashington Post Company investment “locked up Buffett’s reputation\nas a master investor.”16 Berkshire has not sold any of its Washington Post\nstock since the original purchase in 1973. In 2004, the Class B stock was\nselling for more than $900 a share, making it the second most expensive\nstock on the New York Stock Exchange. Berkshire’s holdings are now\nworth more than $1 billion, and Buffett’s original investment has increased in value more than fiftyfold.17\nWells Fargo & Company\nIn October 1990, Berkshire Hathaway announced it had purchased 5\nmillion shares of Wells Fargo & Company at an average price of $57.88\nper share, a total investment of $289 million. With this purchase, Berkshire became the largest shareholder of the bank, owning 10 percent of\nthe shares outstanding.\nIt was a controversial move. Earlier in the year, the share price\ntraded as high as $86, then dropped sharply as investors abandoned\nCalifornia banks in droves. At the time, the West Coast was in the\nthroes of a severe recession and some speculated that banks, with their\nloan portfolios stocked full of commercial and residential mortgages,\nwere in trouble. Wells Fargo, with the most commercial real estate of\nany California bank, was thought to be particularly vulnerable.\nIn the months following Berkshire’s announcement, the battle for\nWells Fargo resembled a heavyweight fight. Buffett, in one corner, was\nthe bull, betting $289 million that Wells Fargo would increase in value.\nIn the other corner, short sellers were the bears, betting that Wells Fargo,\nalready down 49 percent for the year, was destined to fall further. The\nrest of the investment world decided to sit back and watch.\nTwice in 1992, Berkshire acquired more shares, bringing the total\nto 63 million by year-end. The price crept over $100 per share, but\nshort sellers were still betting the stock would lose half its value. Buffett\nhas continued to add to his position, and by year-end 2003, Berkshire\nowned more than 56 million shares, with a market value of $4.6 billion\nand a total accumulated purchase cost of $2.8 billion. In 2003, Moody’s\ngave Wells Fargo a AAA credit rating, the only bank in the country\nwith that distinction.\nTHE INTELLIGENT INVESTOR\nThe most distinguishing trait of Buffett’s investment philosophy is the\nclear understanding that by owning shares of stocks he owns businesses,\nnot pieces of paper. The idea of buying stocks without understanding\nthe company’s operating functions—its products and services, labor relations, raw material expenses, plant and equipment, capital reinvestment requirements, inventories, receivables, and needs for working\ncapital—is unconscionable, says Buffett. This mentality ref lects the attitude of a business owner as opposed to a stock owner, and is the only\nmentality an investor should have. In the summation of The Intelligent\nInvestor, Benjamin Graham wrote, “Investing is most intelligent when\nit is most businesslike.” Those are, says Buffett, “the nine most important words ever written about investing.”\nA person who holds stocks has the choice to become the owner of a\nbusiness or the bearer of tradable securities. Owners of common stocks\nwho perceive that they merely own a piece of paper are far removed\nfrom the company’s financial statements. They behave as if the market’s\never-changing price is a more accurate ref lection of their stock’s value\nthan the business’s balance sheet and income statement. They draw or\ndiscard stocks like playing cards. For Buffett, the activities of a common\nstock holder and a business owner are intimately connected. Both\nshould look at ownership of a business in the same way. “I am a better\ninvestor because I am a businessman,” Buffett says, “and a better businessman because I am an investor.”18\nTHE WARREN BUFFETT WAY\nBusiness Tenets\n1.

    "Investing Guidelines: Business Tenets": "We come now to the heart of the matter—the essence of Warren\nBuffett’s way of thinking about investing. Warren Buffett is so\nthoroughly identified with the stock market that even people\nwho have no interest in the market know his name and reputation.\nOthers, those who read the financial pages of the newspaper only casually, may know him as the head of an unusual company whose stock\nsells for upward of $90,000 per share. And even the many new investors\nwho enthusiastically devote careful attention to market news think of\nhim primarily as a brilliant stock picker.\nFew would deny that the world’s most famous and most successful\ninvestor is indeed a brilliant stock picker. But that seriously understates\nthe case. His real gift is picking companies. I mean this in two senses:\nFirst, Berkshire Hathaway, in addition to its famous stock portfolio,\nowns many companies directly. Second, when considering new stock\npurchases, Buffett looks at the underlying business as thoroughly as he\nwould if he were buying the whole company, using a set of basic principles developed over many years. “When investing,” he says, “we view\nourselves as business analysts—not as market analysts, not as macroeconomic analysts, and not even as security analysts.”1\nIf we go back through time and review all of Buffett’s purchases,\nlooking for the commonalities, we find a set of basic principles, or tenets,\nthat have guided his decisions. If we extract these tenets and spread them\nout for a closer look, we see that they naturally group themselves into\nfour categories:\n1. Business tenets. Three basic characteristics of the business itself\n2. Management tenets. Three important qualities that senior managers must display\n3. Financial tenets. Four critical financial decisions that the company must maintain\n4. Value tenets. Two interrelated guidelines about purchase price\nNot all of Buffett’s acquisitions will display all the tenets, but taken\nas a group, these tenets constitute the core of his investment approach.\nThey can also serve as guideposts for all investors. In this chapter, we\nlook at the first group—the characteristics of the business—and study\nhow some of Buffett’s investment decisions ref lect those tenets.\nI want to be in businesses so good even a dummy can make\nmoney.\nFor Buffett, stocks are an abstraction.3 He does not think in terms of\nmarket theories, macroeconomic concepts, or sector trends. Rather, he\nmakes investment decisions based only on how a business operates. He\nbelieves that if people choose an investment for superficial reasons instead\nof business fundamentals, they are more likely to be scared away at the\nfirst sign of trouble, in all likelihood losing money in the process. Buffett\nconcentrates on learning all he can about the business under consideration, focusing on three main areas:\n1. Is the business simple and understandable?\n2. Does the business have a consistent operating history?\n3. Does the business have favorable long-term prospects?\nIn Buffett’s view, investors’ financial success is correlated to the degree\nin which they understand their investment. This understanding is a distinguishing trait that separates investors with a business orientation from\nmost hit-and-run investors, people who merely buy shares of stock. It is\ncritical to the buy-or-don’t-buy decision for this reason: In the final\nanalysis, after all their research, investors must feel convinced that the\nbusiness they are buying into will perform well over time. They must\nhave some confidence in their estimate of its future earnings, and that has\na great deal to do with how well they understand its business fundamentals. Predicting the future is always tricky; it becomes enormously more\ndifficult in an arena you know nothing about.\nOver the years, Buffett has owned a vast array of businesses: a gas\nstation; a farm implementation business; textile companies; a major retailer; banks; insurance companies; advertising agencies; aluminum and\ncement companies; newspapers; oil, mineral, and mining companies;\nfood, beverage, and tobacco companies; television and cable companies.\nSome of these companies he controlled, and in others he was or is a minority shareholder. But in all cases, he was or is acutely aware of how\nthese businesses operate. He understands the revenues, expenses, cash\nf low, labor relations, pricing f lexibility, and capital allocation needs of\nevery single one of Berkshire’s holdings.\nBuffett is able to maintain a high level of knowledge about Berkshire’s businesses because he purposely limits his selections to companies\nthat are within his area of financial and intellectual understanding. He\ncalls it his “circle of competence.” His logic is compelling: If you own a\ncompany (either fully or some of its shares) in an industry you do not understand, it is impossible to accurately interpret developments and therefore impossible to make wise decisions. “Invest within your circle of\ncompetence,” he counsels. “It’s not how big the circle is that counts, it’s\nhow well you define the parameters.”4\nCritics have argued that Buffett’s self-imposed restrictions exclude\nhim from industries that offer the greatest investment potential, such as\ntechnology. His response: Investment success is not a matter of how\nmuch you know but how realistically you define what you don’t know.\n“An investor needs to do very few things right as long as he or she avoids\nbig mistakes.”5 Producing above-average results, Buffett has learned,\noften comes from doing ordinary things. The key is to do those things\nexceptionally well.\nCoca-Cola Company\nThe business of Coca-Cola is relatively simple. The company purchases\ncommodity inputs and combines them to manufacture a concentrate\nthat is sold to bottlers. The bottlers then combine the concentrate with\nother ingredients and sell the finished product to retail outlets including\nminimarts, supermarkets, and vending machines. The company also\nprovides soft drink syrups to fountain retailers, who sell soft drinks to\nconsumers in cups and glasses.\nThe company’s name brand products include Coca-Cola, Diet\nCoke, Sprite, PiBB Xtra, Mello Yello, Fanta soft drinks, Tab, Dasani,\nand Fresca. The company’s beverages also include Hi-C brand fruit\ndrinks, Minute Maid orange juice, Powerade, and Nestea. The company\nowns 45 percent of Coca-Cola Enterprises, the largest bottler in the\nUnited States, and 35 percent of Coca-Cola Amatil, an Australian bottler that has interests not only in Australia but also in New Zealand and\nEastern Europe.\nThe strength of Coca-Cola is not only its name-brand products but\nalso its unmatched worldwide distribution system. Today, international\nsales of Coca-Cola products account for 69 percent of the company’s\nnet sales and 80 percent of its profits. In addition to Coca-Cola Amatil,\nthe company has equity interests in bottlers located in Mexico, South\nAmerica, Southeast Asia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China.\nThe Washington Post Company\nBuffett’s grandfather once owned and edited the Cuming County Democrat, a weekly newspaper in West Point, Nebraska. His grandmother\nhelped out at the paper and also set the type at the family’s printing shop.\nHis father, while attending the University of Nebraska, edited the Daily\nNebraskan. Buffett himself was once the circulation manager for the\nLincoln Journal. It has often been said that if Buffett had not embarked\non a business career, he most surely would have pursued journalism.\nCASE IN POINT\nBENJAMIN MOORE, 2000\nIn November 2000, Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway\npaid about $1 billion for Benjamin Moore & Co., the Mercedes\nof paint companies. Founded in 1883 by the Moore brothers in\ntheir Brooklyn basement, Benjamin Moore today is fifth largest\npaint manufacturer in the United States and has an unmatched\nreputation for quality.\nIt was reported that Buffett paid a 25 percent premium over\nthe stock’s then current price. On the surface, that might seem\nto contradict one of Buffett’s iron-clad rules: that he will act\nonly when the price is low enough to constitute a margin of\nsafety. However, we also know that Buffett is not afraid to pay\nfor quality. Even more revealing, the stock price jumped 50\npercent to $37.62 per share after the deal was announced. This\ntells us that either Buffett found yet another company that was\nundervalued or else that the rest of the investing world was betting on Buffett’s acumen and traded the price up even higher—\nor both.\nBenjamin Moore is just the sort of company Buffett likes.\nThe paint business is nothing if not simple and easy to understand. One of the largest paint manufacturers in the United\nStates and the tenth largest specialty paint producer, Benjamin\nMoore makes one of the finest, if not the finest, architectural\npaint in the United States. The company is not just famous for\nthe quality of its paint, however; architects, designers, and\nbuilders regard Benjamin Moore colors as the gold standard for\ntheir industry. In fact, the company developed the first computerized color matching system, and it is still recognized as the\nindustry standard. With roughly 3,200 colors, Benjamin Moore\ncan match almost any shade.\nBuffett also tends to buy companies that have a consistent\noperating history and as a result, upon buying a company, he\ndoes not expect to have to change much. His modus operandi is\nto buy companies that are already successful and still have potential for growth. Benjamin Moore’s current success and status\nin the marketplace over the decades speak to the company’s\nconsistent product quality, production, brand strength, and service. Now, 121 years after its founding, the company brings in\nabout $80 million of profit on $900 million in sales.\nLooking at Benjamin Moore, Buffett also saw a well-run\ncompany. Although there were questions a few years ago about\nMoore’s retail strategy, the company has undertaken a brand rejuvenation program in the United States and Canada. Benjamin\nMoore increased its retail presence in independent stores with its\nSignature Store Program and bought certain retail stores, such as\nManhattan-based Janovic, outright. Just before the Berkshire acquisition in 2000, the company underwent a cost-cutting and\nstreamlining program to improve its operations.\nAll that adds up to favorable long-term prospects. Benjamin\nMoore is a classic example of a company that has turned a commodity into a franchise. Buffett’s definition of a franchise is one\nwhere the product is needed or desired, has no close substitute,\nand is unregulated. Most people in the building industry would\nagree that Moore is a master in all three categories. Considering\nthe company’s arsenal of over 100 chemists, chemical engineers,\ntechnicians, and support staff that maintain the company’s strict\nproduct standards and develop new products, the risk of Benjamin Moore paints becoming a perishable commodity is slight.\nThe on-going and rigorous testing to which all the Moore\nproducts are subjected is a sign that Benjamin Moore will continue to set industry standards. Finally, although Benjamin\nMoore products are not cheap, their quality commands pricing\npower that defeats any notion of inf lation.\nIn 1969, Buffett bought his first major newspaper, the Omaha Sun,\nalong with a group of weekly papers; from them he learned the business\ndynamics of a newspaper. He had four years of hands-on experience running a newspaper before he bought his first share of the Washington Post.\nWells Fargo\nBuffett understands the banking business very well. In 1969, Berkshire\nbought 98 percent of the Illinois National Bank and Trust Company\nand held it until 1979, when the Bank Holding Act required Berkshire\nto divest its interest. During that ten-year period, the bank took its\nplace beside Berkshire’s other controlled holdings and Buffett reported\nits sales and earnings each year in Berkshire’s annual reports.\nJust as Jack Ringwalt helped Buffett understand the intricacy of the\ninsurance business, Gene Abegg, who was chairman of\nIllinois National Bank, taught Buffett about the banking business. He\nlearned that banks are profitable businesses as long as loans are issued responsibly and costs are curtailed. A well-managed bank could not only\ngrow its earnings but also earn a handsome return on equity.\nThe key is “well managed.” The long-term value of a bank, as\nBuffett learned, is determined by the actions of its managers, because\nthey control the two critical variables: costs and loans. Bad managers\nhave a way of running up the costs of operations while making foolish\nloans; good managers are always looking for ways to cut costs and rarely\nmake risky loans. Carl Reichardt, then chairman of Wells Fargo, had\nrun the bank since 1983, with impressive results. Under his leadership,\ngrowth in earnings and return on equity were both above average and\noperating efficiencies were among the highest in the country. Reichardt\nhad also built a solid loan portfolio.\nCONSISTENCY\nWarren Buffett cares very little for stocks that are “hot” at any given\nmoment. He is far more interested in buying into companies that he believes will be successful and profitable for the long term. And while\npredicting future success is certainly not foolproof, a steady track record\nis a relatively reliable indicator. When a company has demonstrated\nconsistent results with the same type of products year after year, it is not\nunreasonable to assume that those results will continue.\nAs long, that is, as nothing major changes. Buffett avoids purchasing\ncompanies that are fundamentally changing direction because their previous plans were unsuccessful. It has been his experience that undergoing major business changes increases the likelihood of committing\nmajor business errors.\n“Severe change and exceptional returns usually don’t mix,” Buffett\nobserves.6 Most individuals, unfortunately, invest as if the opposite were\ntrue. Too often, they scramble to purchase stocks of companies that are\nin the midst of a corporate reorganization. For some unexplained reason,\nsays Buffett, these investors are so infatuated with the notion of what tomorrow may bring that they ignore today’s business reality. In contrast,\nBuffett says, his approach is “very much profiting from lack of change.\nThat’s the kind of business I like.”7\nBuffett also tends to avoid businesses that are solving difficult problems. Experience has taught him that turnarounds seldom turn. It can be\nmore profitable to expend energy purchasing good businesses at reasonable prices than difficult businesses at cheaper prices. “Charlie and I have\nnot learned how to solve difficult business problems,” Buffett admits.\n“What we have learned is to avoid them. To the extent that we have\nbeen successful, it is because we concentrated on identifying one-foot\nhurdles that we could step over rather than because we acquired any\nability to clear seven-footers.”8\nThe Coca-Cola Company\nNo other company today can match Coca-Cola’s consistent operating\nhistory. This is a business that was started in the 1880s selling a beverage product. Today, 120 years later, Coca-Cola is selling the same beverage. Even though the company has periodically invested in unrelated\nbusinesses, its core beverage business has remained largely unchanged.\nThe only significant difference today is the company’s size and its\ngeographic reach. One hundred years ago, the company employed ten\ntraveling salesmen to cover the entire United States. At that point, the\ncompany was selling 116,492 gallons of syrup a year, for annual sales of\n$148,000.9 Fifty years later, in 1938, the company was selling 207 million\ncases of soft drinks annually (having converted sales from gallons to\ncases). That year, an article in Fortune noted, “It would be hard to\nname any company comparable to Coca-Cola and selling, as Coca-Cola\ndoes, an unchanged product that can point to a ten year record anything\nlike Coca-Cola’s.”10\nToday, nearly seventy years after that article was published, CocaCola is still selling syrup. The only difference is the increase in quantity.\nBy the year 2003, the company was selling over 19 billion cases of soft\ndrink in more than 200 countries, generating $22 billion a year in sales.\nThe Washington Post Company\nBuffett tells Berkshire’s shareholders that his first financial connection\nwith the Washington Post was at age 13. He delivered both the Washington Post and the Times-Herald on his paper route while his father\nserved in Congress. Buffett likes to remind others that with this dual\ndelivery route he merged the two papers long before Phil Graham\nbought the Times-Herald.\nObviously, Buffett was aware of the newspaper’s rich history. And\nhe considered Newsweek magazine a predictable business. He quickly\nlearned the value of the company’s television stations. The Washington\nPost had been reporting for years the stellar performance of its broadcast\ndivision. Buffett’s personal experience with the company and its own\nsuccessful history led him to believe that the Washington Post was a\nconsistent and dependable business performer.\nGillette\nFew companies have dominated their industry as long as Gillette. It was\nthe lead brand of razors and blades in 1923 and the lead brand in 2003.\nMaintaining that position for so many years has required the company to\nspend hundreds of millions of dollars inventing new, improved products.\nEven though Wilkinson, in 1962, developed the first coated stainless\nsteel blade, Gillette bounced back quickly and has since worked hard to\nremain the world’s leading innovator of shaving products. In 1972,\nGillette developed the popular twin-blade Trac II; in 1977, the Atra\nrazor with its pivoting head. Then, in 1989, the company developed the\npopular Sensor, a razor with independently suspended blades. Gillette’s\nconsistent success is a result of its innovation and patent protection of its\nnew products.\nClayton Homes\nIn fiscal year 2002, Clayton reported its twenty-eighth consecutive\nyear of profits, $126 million, up 16 percent from the year before, on\nrevenue of $1.2 billion.11 This performance is all the more extraordinary when we consider the fearsome problems that others in the industry experienced. In the late 1990s, over 80 factories and 4,000 retailers\nwent out of business, a victim of two colliding forces: Many manufacturers had expanded too quickly and at the same time had made too\nmany weak loans, which inevitably led to widespread repossessions, followed by diminished demand for new housing.\nClayton had a different way of doing business (more about their policies in Chapter 6). Its sound management and skillful handling of rough\ntimes enabled the company to maintain profitability even as competitors\nwere going bankrupt.\n“We like stocks that generate high returns on invested capital,” Buffett\ntold those in attendance at Berkshire’s 1995 annual meeting, “where\nthere is a strong likelihood that it will continue to do so.”12 “I look at\nlong-term competitive advantage,” he later added, “and [whether] that’s\nsomething that’s enduring.”13 That means he looks for what he terms\nfranchises.\nAccording to Buffett, the economic world is divided into a small\ngroup of franchises and a much larger group of commodity businesses,\nmost of which are not worth purchasing. He defines a franchise as a\ncompany whose product or service (1) is needed or desired, (2) has no\nclose substitute, and (3) is not regulated.\nIndividually and collectively, these create what Buffett calls a moat—\nsomething that gives the company a clear advantage over others and protects it against incursions from the competition. The bigger the moat, the\nmore sustainable, the better he likes it. “The key to investing,” he says,\nis determining the competitive advantage of any given company and,\nabove all, the durability of that advantage. The products or services that\nhave wide, sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors.”14 (To see what a moat looks like, read the story of\nLarson-Juhl in Chapter 8.)\nA franchise that is the only source of a product people want can\nregularly increase prices without fear of losing market share or unit volume. Often a franchise can raise its prices even when demand is f lat and\ncapacity is not fully utilized. This pricing f lexibility is one of the defining characteristics of a franchise; it allows franchises to earn aboveaverage returns on invested capital.\nLook for the durability of the franchise. The most important\nthing to me is figuring out how big a moat there is around the\nbusiness. What I love, of course, is a big castle and a big moat\nwith piranhas and crocodiles.15\nWARREN BUFFETT, 1994\nAnother defining characteristic is that franchises possess a greater\namount of economic goodwill, which enables them to better withstand\nthe effects of inf lation. Another is the ability to survive economic\nmishaps and still endure. In Buffett’s succinct phrase, “The definition of\na great company is one that will be great for 25 to 30 years.”16\nConversely, a commodity business offers a product that is virtually\nindistinguishable from the products of its competitors. Years ago, basic\ncommodities included oil, gas, chemicals, wheat, copper, lumber, and\norange juice. Today, computers, automobiles, airline service, banking,\nand insurance have become commodity-type products. Despite mammoth advertising budgets, they are unable to achieve meaningful product differentiation.\nCommodity businesses, generally, are low-returning businesses and\n“prime candidates for profit trouble.”17 Since their product is basically\nno different from anyone else’s, they can compete only on the basis of\nprice, which severely undercuts profit margins. The most dependable\nCASE IN POINT\nJUSTIN INDUSTRIES, 2000\nIn July 2000, Berkshire Hathaway bought 100 percent of Texasbased Justin Industries for $600 million. The company has two\ndivisions: Justin Brands, which comprises four brands of Western boots, and Acme Building Brands, with companies that\nmake bricks and other building products.\nCowboy boots and bricks. It is one of Berkshire’s most interesting, and most colorful, acquisitions. And it says a great\ndeal about Warren Buffett.\nIn many ways, Justin epitomizes all the business strengths\nthat Buffett looks for. Clearly, it is simple and understandable;\nthere’s nothing particularly complex about boots or bricks. It\nrepresents a remarkably consistent operating history, as a look\nat the separate companies will show; all have been at the same\nbusiness for many decades, and most are at least a century old.\nFinally, and most especially, Buffett recognized favorable longterm prospects, because of one aspect that he highly admires: in\nwhat are essentially commodity industries, the products have\nachieved franchise status.\nJustin Brands\nThe company that is now Justin began in 1879 when H. J. ( Joe)\nJustin, who was then 20 years old, started making boots for\ncowboys and ranchers from his small shop in Spanish Fort,\nTexas, near the Chisholm Trail. When Joe died in 1918, his\nsons John and Earl took over and in 1925 moved the company\nto Fort Worth. In 1948, Joe’s grandson John Jr. bought out his\nrelatives (except Aunt Enid), and guided the business for the\nnext fifty years.\nJohn Justin Jr. was a legendary figure in Fort Worth. He\nbuilt an empire of Western boots by acquiring three rival companies, worked out the deal to buy Acme Bricks in 1968, and\nserved a term as Fort Worth mayor. He retired in 1999, but\nstayed on as chairman emeritus, and that’s why, at the age of 83,\nit was he who welcomed Warren Buffett to town in April 2000.\nJustin Boots, known for rugged, long-lasting boots for\nworking cowboys, remains the f lagship brand. But Justin Brands\nincludes other names.\nNocona, founded in 1925 by Enid Justin. One of Joe\nJustin’s seven children, Enid started working in her father’s\ncompany when she was twelve. After her nephews moved\nthe family business from the small town of Nocona, Texas,\nto Fort Worth in 1925, Enid set up a rival company in the\noriginal locale. Against all odds, she built a success. Fierce\ncompetitors for years, the two companies were joined under\nthe Justin name in 1981. Enid, who was then 85, reluctantly\nagreed to the merger because of her declining health.\nChippewa, founded in 1901 as a maker of boots for loggers, today makes sturdy hiking boots and quality outdoor\nwork boots. It was acquired by Justin in 1985.\nTony Lama, which dates back to 1911, when Tony Lama,\nwho had been a cobbler in the U.S. Army, opened a shoerepair and boot-making shop in El Paso. The boots quickly\nbecame a favorite of local ranchers and cowboys who valued\nthe good fit and long-lasting quality. In recent years, for\nmany the Tony Lama name has become synonymous with\nhigh-end boots handcrafted from exotic leathers such as boa,\nalligator, turtle, and ostrich, many with prices near $500. In\n1990, Tony Lama Jr., chairman and CEO, agreed to merge\nwith archrival Justin.\nTwo groups of people buy Western-style boots: those who\nwear them day in and day out, because they can’t imagine\nwearing anything else; and those who wear them as fashion.\nThe first group is the heart of Justin’s customer base, but the\nsecond group, while smaller, does have an impact on sales volume as fashion trends twist and turn.\nWhen big-name designers like Ralph Lauren and Calvin\nKlein show Western styles in their catalogs, boot sales climb. But\nfashion is notoriously fickle, and the company struggled in the\nlate 1990s. After a peak in 1994, the sales of Western boots\nbegan to decline. In 1999, Justin’s stock price dipped below $13.\nJohn Justin Jr. retired in April 1999, and John Roach, former\nhead of the Tandy Corp., came in to lead a restructuring. In just\nover a year, the new management engineered an impressive\nturnaround—adding new footwear products, consolidating the\nexisting lines to eliminate duplicate designs, and instituting efficiencies in manufacturing and distribution. In April 2000, the\nstreamlined company announced first quarter results: footwear\nsales rose 17 percent to $41.1 million, and both net earnings and\ngross margins increased significantly.\nTwo months later, Berkshire Hathaway announced it had\nreached an agreement to buy the company, prompting Bear\nStearns analyst Gary Schneider to comment, “This is good\nnews for employees. Management made all the changes last\nyear. They’ve already taken the tough measures necessary to\nlower costs.”18\nToday the boot division of Justin has 4,000 vendors and\nabout 35 percent of the Western footwear market; in stores that\nspecialize in Western apparel, some 70 percent of the boots on\nthe shelves are Justin brands. Most prices start at around $100.\nIn the higher price brackets (several hundred dollars and up),\nJustin has about 65 percent of market share.\nAcme Building Brands\nThe other division of Justin Industries is also a pioneer Texas\ncompany that is more than a century old. Founded in 1891 in\nMilsap, Texas, Acme became a Justin company in 1968, when\nJohn Justin Jr. bought it. Today, Acme is the largest and most\nprofitable brick manufacturer in the country.\nBecause long-distance shipping costs are prohibitive, bricks\ntend to be a regional product. Acme dominates its region\n(Texas and five surrounding states) with more than 50 percent\nof market share. In its six-state area, Acme has 31 production\nfacilities, including 22 brick plants, its own sales offices, and\nits own f leet of trucks. Builders, contractors, and homeowners\ncan order bricks direct from the company, and they will be\ndelivered on Acme trucks. Acme sells more than one billion\nbricks a year, each one stamped with the Acme logo, and each\none guaranteed for 100 years.\nDemand for bricks is tied to housing starts and, therefore,\nsubject to changes in interest rates and in the overall economy.\nEven a run of bad weather can affect sales. Nonetheless, Acme\nfared better during the techno-crazed 1990s than the boot\ncompanies, and today is still the chief Justin money-maker. In\naddition to its bricks, Acme Building Brands includes Featherlite Building Products Corporation (concrete masonry) and\nthe American Tile Supply Company, maker of ceramic and\nmarble tiles.\nThe Berkshire Deal\nFor years Justin was largely ignored by Wall Street. With just\ntwo divisions, it was not large enough to be a conglomerate.\nYet, operating in two different categories made it something of\na puzzlement. As John Justin noted in 1999, just before he retired, “The analysts who understand the footwear business\ndon’t understand the building materials business, and the other\nway around.”19\nWarren Buffett understands both. For one thing, Berkshire already owned several footwear companies, so he had\nyears to learn the industry. More to the point, he understands\nstable, steady businesses that make products people never stop\nneeding.\nAnd the timing was right. The company with a reputation\nfor more than 100 years of quality was facing rocky times; its\nstock price had dropped 37 percent over the prior five years, and\nthere was pressure to split the company into two parts. Buffett’s\nwell-known preference for simple, low-tech businesses made\nthis a perfect fit.\nWhen Buffett first met with John Justin in Fort Worth, he\nremarked that the city reminded him of Omaha; he meant it as\na great compliment. When he looked into the two components\nof the company, he saw something else he admires: franchise\nquality. Both divisions of Justin have managed to turn themselves into a franchise, through a combination of top quality,\ngood marketing, and shrewd positioning.\nAcme sells a product that most people consider a commodity.\nWho, after all, can name the brand of bricks they prefer? Acme\ncustomers, that’s who. With a skillful marketing campaign featuring football legend Troy Aikman, Acme has made itself so\nwell known that when Texans were recently asked to name their\nfavorite brand of brick, 75 percent of respondents said Acme.\nThat brand consciousness is reinforced every time a consumer\npicks up a brick and sees the Acme logo stamped into it.\nThe boots, too, have established themselves as franchises.\nSpend a few minutes in any Western-apparel retail outlet, and\nyou’ll hear customers say things like “My son is ready for some\nnew Justins” or “Show me what you’ve got in Tony Lamas”\nmore often than you hear “I’m looking for some cowboy boots.”\nWhen they mention the boots by name, and when they’re willing to pay top price for top quality, that’s a franchise.\nAfter the improvements of its new management team in\n1999 and 2000, Justin began attracting attention. According to\nBear Stearns analyst Gary Schneider, there was widespread interest from many buyers, including Europeans, but Buffett’s\nwas the first offer the company seriously contemplated.20\nBerkshire’s offer was for $22 per share in cash. That represented a 23 percent premium over closing stock price, but Buffett was not fazed. “It was a chance to get not only one good\nbusiness but two good businesses at one time,” he remarked.\n“A double dip, in effect. First-class businesses with first-class\nmanagements, and that’s just what we look for.” Nor, he\nadded, did he have plans to change anything. “We buy business\nthat are running well to start with. If they needed me in Fort\nWorth, we wouldn’t be buying it.”21 The day after the deal\nwas announced, Justin’s stock price jumped 22 percent, and\nWarren Buffett returned to Omaha with a brand-new pair of\nostrich-skin Tony Lamas.\nway to make a commodity business profitable, then, is to be the lowcost provider.\nThe only other time commodity businesses turn a profit is during\nperiods of tight supply—a factor that can be extremely difficult to\npredict. In fact, a key to determining the long-term profitability of\na commodity business, Buffett notes, is the ratio of “supply-tight to\nsupply-ample years.” This ratio, however, is often fractional. The most\nrecent supply-tight period in Berkshire’s textile division, Buffett quips,\nlasted the “better part of a morning.”\nThe Coca-Cola Company\nShortly after Berkshire’s 1989 public announcement that it owned 6.3\npercent of the Coca-Cola Company, Buffett was interviewed by Mellisa Turner, a business writer for the Atlanta Constitution. She asked\nBuffett a question he has been asked often: Why hadn’t he purchased\nshares in the company sooner? By way of answer, Buffett related what\nhe was thinking at the time he finally made the decision.\n“Let’s say you were going away for ten years,” he explained, “and\nyou wanted to make one investment and you know everything that you\nknow now, and you couldn’t change it while you’re gone. What would\nyou think about? Of course, the business would have to be simple and\nunderstandable. Of course, the company would have to have demonstrated a great deal of business consistency over the years. And of\ncourse, the long-term prospects would have to be favorable. “If I came\nup with anything in terms of certainty, where I knew the market was\ngoing to continue to grow, where I knew the leader was going to continue to be the leader—I mean worldwide—and where I knew there\nwould be big unit growth, I just don’t know anything like Coke. I’d be\nrelatively sure that when I came back they would be doing a hell of a lot\nmore business than they do now.”22\nBut why purchase at that particular time? Coca-Cola’s business attributes, as described by Buffett, have existed for several decades. What\ncaught his eye, he confesses, were the changes occurring at Coca-Cola,\nduring the 1980s, under the leadership of Roberto Goizueta.\nGoizueta, raised in Cuba, was Coca-Cola’s first foreign chief executive officer. In 1980, Robert Woodruff, the company’s 91-year-old\npatriarch, brought him in to correct the problems that had plagued the\ncompany during the 1970s. It was a dismal period for Coca-Cola—disputes with bottlers, accusations of mistreatment of migrant workers at\nthe company’s Minute Maid groves, environmentalists’ claim that\nCoke’s “one way” containers contributed to the country’s growing pollution problem, and the Federal Trade Commission charge that the\ncompany’s exclusive franchise system violated the Sherman Anti-Trust\nAct. Coca-Cola’s international business was reeling as well.\nOne of Goizueta’s first acts was to bring together Coca-Cola’s top\nfifty managers for a meeting in Palm Springs, California. “Tell me\nwhat we’re doing wrong,” he said. “I want to know it all and once it’s\nsettled, I want 100 percent loyalty. If anyone is not happy, we will make\nyou a good settlement and say goodbye.”23\nGoizueta encouraged his managers to take intelligent risks. He\nwanted Coca-Cola to initiate action rather than to be reactive. He began\ncutting costs. And he demanded that any business that Coca-Cola owned\nmust optimize its return on assets. These actions immediately translated\ninto increasing profit margins. And captured the attention of Warren\nBuffett.\nThe Washington Post Company\n“The economics of a dominant newspaper,” Buffett once wrote, “are\nexcellent, among the very best in the world.”24 The vast majority of\nU.S. newspapers operate without any direct competition. The owners of\nthose newspapers like to believe that the exceptional profits they earn\neach year are a result of their paper’s journalistic quality. The truth, said\nBuffett, is that even a third-rate newspaper can generate adequate profits if it is the only paper in town. That makes it a classic franchise, with\nall the benefits thereof.\nIt is true that a high-quality paper will achieve a greater penetration\nrate, but even a mediocre paper, he explains, is essential to a community\nfor its “bulletin board” appeal. Every business in town, every home seller,\nevery individual who wants to get a message out to the community needs\nthe circulation of a newspaper to do so. The paper’s owner receives, in effect, a royalty on every business in town that wants to advertise.\nIn addition to their franchise quality, newspapers possess valuable\neconomic goodwill. As Buffett points out, newspapers have low capital\nneeds, so they can easily translate sales into profits. Even expensive\ncomputer-assisted printing presses and newsroom electronic systems are\nquickly paid for by lower fixed wage costs. Newspapers also are able to\nincrease prices relatively easily, thereby generating above-average returns on invested capital and reducing the harmful effects of inf lation.\nBuffett figures that a typical newspaper could double its price and still\nretain 90 percent of its readership.\nThe McLane Company\nMcLane is perched on the edge of great growth potential. Now that it\nis no longer part of Wal-Mart, it is free to pursue arrangements with\nWal-Mart’s competitors, such as Target and other large stores in the\nUnited States. This, combined with the company’s focus on efficiency\nand investment in enterprise-wide software systems, freight management, and point-of-sales systems among other automated processes, will\nenable McLane to maintain price efficiency and service quality.\nAt the time Buffett bought McLane, some of the industry players,\nsuch as Fleming and U.S. Food Service, a division of Royal Ahold,\nwere going through difficult times for various reasons. Although it is\ndoubtful that this inf luenced Buffett’s decision, it was said at the time\nthat if Fleming did indeed go under, an extra $7 billion worth of business would be up for grabs.\nThe Pampered Chef\nThe Pampered Chef has demonstrated a consistency that many older\nbusinesses might well envy, with a growth rate of 22 percent each year\nfrom 1995 to 2001. And the long-term outlook is strong. According to\nthe Direct Selling Association, party plan businesses raked in more than\n$7 billion nationwide in 2000, an increase of $2.7 billion since 1996.\nChristopher herself is not slowing down. She believes that American cupboards have plenty of room for more products and points out\nthat Mary Kay, a direct-sell cosmetics company, has a sales force of\n600,000—giving her plenty of room to grow. Christopher is developing new products, such as ceramic serving ware, and is expanding into\nCanada, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Finally, the company is\nstructured in such a way that it does not need a lot of capital to expand\nand it has no sizable competition in its category.",
    "Investing Guidelines: Management Tenets": "When considering a new investment or a business acquisition,\nBuffett looks very hard at the quality of management. He tells\nus that the companies or stocks Berkshire purchases must be\noperated by honest and competent managers whom he can admire and\ntrust. “We do not wish to join with managers who lack admirable qualities,” he says, “no matter how attractive the prospects of their business.\nWe’ve never succeeded in making a good deal with a bad person.”1\nWhen he finds managers he admires, Buffett is generous with his\npraise. Year after year, readers of the Chairman’s Letter in Berkshire’s\nannual reports find Buffett’s warm words about those who manage the\nvarious Berkshire companies.\nHe is just as thorough when it comes to the management of companies whose stock he has under consideration. In particular, he looks\nfor three traits:\n1. Is management rational?\n2. Is management candid with the shareholders?\n3. Does management resist the institutional imperative?\nThe highest compliment Buffett can pay a manager is that he or she\nunfailingly behaves and thinks like an owner of the company. Managers\nwho behave like owners tend not to lose sight of the company’s prime\nobjective—increasing shareholder value—and they tend to make rational\ndecisions that further that goal. Buffett also greatly admires managers\nwho take seriously their responsibility to report fully and genuinely to\nshareholders and who have the courage to resist what he has termed the\ninstitutional imperative—blindly following industry peers.\nWhen you have able managers of high character running businesses about which they are passionate, you can have a dozen or\nmore reporting to you and still have time for an afternoon nap.2\nWARREN BUFFETT, 1986\nAll this has taken on a new level of urgency, as shocking discoveries\nof corporate wrongdoings have come to light. Buffett has always insisted\non doing business only with people of the highest integrity. Sometimes\nthat stance has put him at odds with other well-known names in the\ncorporate world. It has not always been fashionable in business circles to\nspeak of integrity, honesty, and trustworthiness as qualities to be admired. In fact, at times such talk might have been disparaged as naive\nand out of touch with business reality. It is a particularly sweet bit of\npoetic justice that Buffett’s stand on corporate integrity now seems to\nbe a brilliant strategy. But his motivation is not strategic: It comes from\nhis own unshakable value system. And no one has ever seriously accused\nWarren Buffett of being naive.\nLater in this chapter, we look more deeply into Buffett’s responses to\nthese issues of ethical corporate behavior, particularly excessive executive\ncompensation, stock options, director independence and accountability,\nand accounting trickery. He tells us what he thinks must be changed to\nprotect shareholder interests and gives us ideas on how investors can evaluate managers to determine whether they are trustworthy.\nThe most important management act, Buffett believes, is allocation of\nthe company’s capital. It is the most important because allocation of\nCASE IN POINT\nSHAW INDUSTRIES, 2000–2002\nIn late 2000, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway group agreed\nto acquire 87 percent of Shaw Industries, the world’s largest carpet manufacturer, for $19 per share, or approximately $2 billion.\nAlthough the price was a 56 percent premium over the trading\nprice of $12.19, Shaw’s share price had been a good deal higher\na year earlier. Buffett paid the premium because the company\nhad so many of the qualities he likes to see: The business was\nsimple and understandable, had a consistent operating history,\nand exhibited favorable long-term prospects.\nCarpet manufacturing is not simplistic, given the gargantuan\nand complicated machines that spin, dye, tuft, and weave, but\nthe basic premise is simple and understandable: to make the best\ncarpets possible and sell them profitably. Shaw now produces\nabout 27,000 styles and colors of tufted and woven carpet for\nhomes and commercial use. It also sells f looring and project\nmanagement services. It has more than 100 manufacturing plants\nand distribution centers and makes more than 600 million\nsquare yards of carpet a year and employs about 30,000 workers.\nBuffett clearly believed that people would need carpets and\nf looring for a long time to come and that Shaw would be there to\nprovide them. That translates to excellent long-term prospects,\none of Buffett’s requirements.\nWhat really attracted Buffett, however, was the company’s\nsenior management. In his 2000 annual report to shareholders,\nhe commented about the Shaw transaction. “A key feature of\nthe deal was that Julian Saul, president, and Bob Shaw, CEO,\nwere to continue to own at least 5 percent of Shaw. This leaves\nus associated with the best in the business as shown by Bob and\nJulian’s record: Each built a large, successful carpet business before joining forces in 1998.”3\nFrom 1960 to 1980, the company delivered a 27 percent average annual return on investment. In 1980, Bob Shaw predicted\nthat his company would quadruple its $214 million in sales in\nten years; he did it in eight years.\nClearly, Bob Shaw managed his company well, and in a\nway that fits neatly with Buffett’s approach. “You have to\ngrow from earnings,” Shaw said. “If you use that as your philosophy—that you grow out of earnings rather than by borrowing—and you manage your balance sheet, then you never get\ninto serious trouble.”4\nThis type of thinking is right up Buffett Alley. He believes\nthat management’s most important act is the allocation of capital and that this allocation, over time, will determine shareholder value. In Buffett’s mind, the issue is simple: If extra cash\ncan be reinvested internally and produce a return higher than\nthe cost of capital, then the company should retain its earnings\nand reinvest them, which is exactly what Shaw did.\nIt was not just that Bob Shaw made good financial decisions, he also made strong product and business decisions by\nadapting to changing market conditions. For example, Shaw\nretrofitted all of its machines in 1986 when DuPont came out\nwith new stain-resistant fibers. “Selling is just meeting people,\nfiguring out what they need, and supplying their needs,” Shaw\nsaid. “But those needs are ever changing. So if you’re doing\nbusiness the same way you did it five years ago, or even two\nyears ago—you’re doing it wrong.”5\nShaw’s strong management is ref lected in the company’s\nconsistent operating history. It has grown to the number one\ncarpet seller in the world, overcoming changing marketplace\nconditions, changes in technology, and even the loss of major\noutlets. In 2002, Sears, one of Shaw’s largest vendors at the time,\nclosed its carpet business. But the management appeared to see\nthose difficulties more as challenges to overcome rather than\nbarriers to success.\nIn 2002, Berkshire bought the remaining portion of Shaw\nthat it did not already own. By 2003, Shaw was bringing in\n$4.6 billion in sales. Except for the insurance segment, it is\nBerkshire’s largest company.\ncapital, over time, determines shareholder value. Deciding what to do\nwith the company’s earnings—reinvest in the business, or return money\nto shareholders—is, in Buffett’s mind, an exercise in logic and rationality. “Rationality is the quality that Buffett thinks distinguishes his style\nwith which he runs Berkshire—and the quality he often finds lacking in\nother corporations,” writes Carol Loomis of Fortune. 6\nThe issue usually becomes important when a company reaches a certain level of maturity, where its growth rate slows and it begins to generate more cash than it needs for development and operating costs. At\nthat point, the question arises: How should those earnings be allocated?\nIf the extra cash, reinvested internally, can produce an above-average\nreturn on equity—a return that is higher than the cost of capital—then\nthe company should retain all its earnings and reinvest them. That is the\nonly logical course. Retaining earnings to reinvest in the company at\nless than the average cost of capital is completely irrational. It is also\nquite common.\nA company that provides average or below-average investment returns but generates cash in excess of its needs has three options: (1) It\ncan ignore the problem and continue to reinvest at below-average rates,\n(2) it can buy growth, or (3) it can return the money to shareholders. It\nis at this crossroad that Buffett keenly focuses on management. It is here\nthat managers will behave rationally or irrationally.\nGenerally, managers who continue to reinvest despite belowaverage returns do so in the belief that the situation is temporary. They\nare convinced that, with managerial prowess, they can improve their\ncompany’s profitability. Shareholders become mesmerized with management’s forecast of improvements.\nIf a company continually ignores this problem, cash will become an\nincreasingly idle resource and the stock price will decline. A company\nwith poor economic returns, a lot of cash, and a low stock price will attract corporate raiders, which often is the beginning of the end of current management tenure. To protect themselves, executives frequently\nchoose the second option instead: purchasing growth by acquiring another company.\nAnnouncing acquisition plans excites shareholders and dissuades corporate raiders. However, Buffett is skeptical of companies that need to\nbuy growth. For one thing, it often comes at an overvalued price. For\nCASE IN POINT FRUIT OF THE LOOM, 2002\nIn 2002, Warren Buffett bought the core business (apparel) of\nbankrupt Fruit of the Loom for $835 million in cash. With the\npurchase, Berkshire acquired two strong assets: an outstanding\nmanager and one of the country’s best-known and best-loved\nbrand names. It also acquired some $1.6 billion in debt, and a\nbitter history of ill will among shareholders, suppliers, retailers,\nand consumers.\nThe company that sells one-third of all men’s and boys’ underwear in the United States started as a small Rhode Island mill\nin 1851. Over the next century, it grew into the nation’s leading\nmaker of underwear and T-shirts. It could not, however, escape\nthe economic struggles that increasingly threatened the apparel\nindustry, and in 1985 was snapped up by financier William Farley, known for acquiring financially troubled companies.\nFarley, often described as “f lashy” and “f lamboyant,”\nguided the company through a few years of growth and then\ninto a disastrous decline. Everything seemed to go wrong. An\naggressive $900 million acquisitions program left the company\nover-leveraged—long-term debt was 128 percent of common\nshareholders’ equity in 1996—without providing the expected\nrise in revenues. Suppliers went unpaid and stopped shipping raw\nmaterials. Farley moved 95 percent of manufacturing operations\noffshore, closing more than a dozen U.S. plants and displacing\nsome 16,000 workers, only to find that the net result was serious\nproblems of quality control and on-time delivery. To counteract\nthe delivery snafus, he parceled out the manufacturing to contract firms, adding enormous layers of overtime costs. He created\na holding company for Fruit of the Loom and moved its headquarters to the Cayman Islands, avoiding U.S. taxes on foreign\nsales but triggering a massive public relations headache.\nThe headache got worse when Farley, in a maneuver that is\nnow illegal, convinced his hand-picked board to guarantee a\npersonal bank loan of $65 million in case he defaulted—which\nhe did. The board, which earlier had set his compensation at\nnearly $20 million and repriced stock options to significantly\nfavor key executives, then forgave $10 million of the loan.\nIn spite of the cost-cutting attempts, the company was\nsinking deeper into the red. In 1999, Fruit of the Loom posted\nlosses of $576 million, seven times larger than analysts’ expectations; and gross margins sagged to a paltry 2 percent, not\nenough to cover the $100 million interest expense needed to\nservice its $1.4 billion debt. That same year the Council of Institutional Investors listed Fruit of the Loom as one of the nation’s twenty most underperforming companies. Shareholders\ncringed as the stock price plunged: From $44 a share in early\n1997 to just over $1 by the end of 1999; in that one year, 1999,\nthe shares lost more than 90 percent of their value.\nFew were surprised, therefore, when the company filed for\nChapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 1999. The company’s shares sank even lower, and by October 2001 were down\nto $0.23.\nSo why would Warren Buffett be interested? Two reasons:\na very strong brand that offered growth potential under the\nright management, and the arrival of a man on a white horse.\nJohn B. Holland had been a highly respected executive\nwith Fruit of the Loom for more than twenty years, including\nseveral years as president and CEO, when he retired in 1996. In\n2000, he was brought back as executive vice-president charged\nwith revamping operations.\nHolland represents a perfect example of the management\nqualities Buffett insists upon. Although publicly he remained\nlargely silent about Farley, beyond a brief reference to “poor\nmanagement,” Buffett has made no secret of his disdain for executives who bully their boards into sweet compensation deals,\nand boards that allow it. In contrast, he is enthusiastically vocal\nabout his admiration for Holland.\nHe explained his thinking to Berkshire shareholders: “John\nHolland was responsible for Fruit’s operations in its most bountiful years. . . . [After the bankruptcy] John was rehired, and he\nundertook a major reworking of operations. Before John’s return, deliveries were chaotic, costs soared, and relations with key\ncustomers deteriorated. . . . He’s been restoring the old Fruit of\nthe Loom, albeit in a much more competitive environment. [In\nour purchase offer] we insisted on a very unusual proviso: John\nhad to be available to continue serving as CEO after we took\nover. To us, John and the brand are Fruit’s key assets.”7\nSince Holland took the reins, Fruit of the Loom has undergone a massive restructuring to lower its costs. It slashed its\nfreight costs, reduced overtime, and trimmed inventory levels. It\ndisposed of sideline businesses, eliminated unprofitable product\nlines, found new efficiencies in manufacturing process, and\nworked to restore customer satisfaction by filling orders on time.\nAlmost immediately, improvement was apparent. Earnings\nincreased, operating expenses decreased. In 2000, gross earnings\nrose by $160.3 million—a 222 percent increase—compared to\n1999, and gross margin increased 11 percentage points. The\ncompany reported an operating loss in 2000 of $44.2 million,\ncompared to the 1999 loss of $292.3 million. Even more revealing of improvement are the fourth-quarter results—an operating\nloss of $13.5 million (which included one-time consolidation\ncosts related to the closure of four U.S. plants) in 2000, compared to $218.6 million—more than sixteen times greater—just\none year earlier.\nIn 2001, the positive trend continued. Gross earnings grew\nanother $72.5 million, a 31 percent increase over 2000, and gross\nmargin increased 7.7 percentage points to 22.7 percent for the\nyear. That means the company ended 2001 with operating earnings of $70.1 million, compared to 2000’s $44.2 million loss.\nOf course monumental problems such as the company faced\nare not fully corrected overnight, and Fruit of the Loom must\nstill operate in a ferociously competitive industry environment,\nbut so far Buffett is pleased with the company’s performance.\nLest anyone still consider buying a debt-ridden bankrupt\ncompany a surprising move, there was also a third reason for\nBuffett’s decision, which should come as no surprise whatsoever: He was able to acquire the company on very favorable financial terms.\nBuying an underwear maker creates lots of opportunities\nfor corny jokes, and Buffett, an accomplished punster, made the\nmost of it. At the 2002 shareholders meeting, when asked the\nobvious question, he teased the audience with a half answer:\n“When I wear underwear at all, which I rarely do . . .” Leaving\nthe crowd to decide for themselves whether it’s boxers or briefs\nfor Buffett. He pointed out why there’s “a favorable bottom\nline” in underwear: “It’s an elastic market.” Finally, he deadpanned, Charlie Munger had given him an additional reason to\nbuy the company: “For years Charlie has been telling me,\n‘Warren, we have to get into women’s underwear.’ Charlie is\n78. It’s now or never.”8\nanother, a company that must integrate and manage a new business is apt\nto make mistakes that could be costly to shareholders.\nIn Buffett’s mind, the only reasonable and responsible course for\ncompanies that have a growing pile of cash that cannot be reinvested at\nabove-average rates is to return that money to the shareholders. For that,\ntwo methods are available: raising the dividend or buying back shares.\nWith cash in hand from their dividends, shareholders have the opportunity to look elsewhere for higher returns. On the surface, this seems to\nbe a good deal, and therefore many people view increased dividends as a\nsign of companies that are doing well. Buffett believes that this is so only\nif investors can get more for their cash than the company could generate\nif it retained the earnings and reinvested in the company.\nOver the years, Berkshire Hathaway has earned very high returns\nfrom its capital and has retained all its earnings. With such high returns,\nshareholders would have been ill served if they were paid a dividend.\nNot surprisingly, Berkshire does not pay a dividend. And that’s just fine\nwith the shareholders. The ultimate test of owners’ faith is allowing\nmanagement to reinvest 100 percent of earnings; Berkshire’s owners’\nfaith in Buffett is high.\nIf the real value of dividends is sometimes misunderstood, the second\nmechanism for returning earnings to the shareholders—stock repurchase—is even more so. The benefit to the owners is in many respects\nless direct, less tangible, and less immediate.\nWhen management repurchases stock, Buffett feels that the reward is\ntwofold. If the stock is selling below its intrinsic value, then purchasing\nshares makes good business sense. If a company’s stock price is $50 and its\nintrinsic value is $100, then each time management buys its stock, they\nare acquiring $2 of intrinsic value for every $1 spent. Such transactions\ncan be highly profitable for the remaining shareholders.\nFurthermore, says Buffett, when executives actively buy the company’s stock in the market, they are demonstrating that they have the\nbest interests of their owners at hand rather than a careless need to expand the corporate structure. That kind of stance sends good signals to\nthe market, attracting other investors looking for a well-managed company that increases shareholders’ wealth. Frequently, shareholders are rewarded twice; first from the initial open market purchase and then\nsubsequently from the positive effect of investor interest on price.\nCoca-Cola\nGrowth in net cash f low has allowed Coca-Cola to increase its dividend\nto shareholders and also repurchase its shares in the open market. In\n1984, the company authorized its first-ever buyback, announcing it\nwould repurchase 6 million shares of stock. Since then, the company has\nrepurchased more than 1 billion shares. This represented 32 percent of\nthe shares outstanding as of January 1, 1984, at an average price per share\nof $12.46. In other words, the company spent approximately $12.4 billion to buy in shares that only ten years later would have a market value\nof approximately $60 billion.\nIn July 1992, the company announced that through the year 2000, it\nwould buy back 100 million shares of its stock, representing 7.6 percent\nof the company’s outstanding shares. Remarkably, because of its strong\ncash-generating abilities, the company was able to accomplish this while\nit continued its aggressive investment in overseas markets.\nAmerican Express\nBuffett’s association with American Express dates back some forty\nyears, to his bold purchase of its distressed stock in 1963, and the astronomical profits he quickly earned for his investment partners (see\nChapter 1 for the full story). Buffett’s faith in the company has not diminished, and he has continued to purchase its stock. A big buy in 1994\ncan be traced to management decisions, both good and bad, about the\nuse of excess cash.\nThe division of the company that issues the charge card and travelers’ checks, American Express Travel Related Services, contributes the\nlion’s share of profits. It has always generated substantial owner earnings and has easily funded its own growth. In the early 1990s, it was\ngenerating more cash than it needed for operations—the very point at\nwhich management actions collide with Buffett’s acid test. In this case,\nAmerican Express management did not do well.\nThen-CEO James Robinson decided to use excess cash to build the\ncompany into a financial services powerhouse by buying other related\nbusinesses. His first acquisition, IDS Financial Services, proved profitable. But then he bought Shearson Lehman, which did not. Over\ntime, Shearson needed more and more cash to carry its operations.\nWhen Shearson had swallowed up $4 billion, Robinson contacted Buffett, who agreed to buy $300 million worth of preferred shares. Until\nthe company got back on track, he was not at all interested in buying\ncommon stock.\nIn 1992, Robinson abruptly resigned and was replaced by Harvey\nGolub. He set himself the immediate task of strengthening brand\nawareness. Striking a familiar tone with Buffett, he began using terms\nsuch as franchise and brand value to describe the American Express\nCard. Over the next two years, Golub began to liquidate the company’s\nunderperforming assets and to restore profitability and high returns on\nequity. One of his first actions was to get rid of Shearson Lehman, with\nits massive capital needs.\nSoon American Express was showing signs of its old profitable self.\nThe resources of the company were solidly behind Golub’s goal of building the American Express Card into “the world’s most respected service\nbrand,” and every communication from the company emphasized the\nfranchise value of the name “American Express.”\nNext, Golub set financial targets for the company: to increase earnings per share by 12 to 15 percent a year and 18 to 20 percent return on\nequity. Before long, the company was again generating excess cash and\nhad more capital and more shares than it needed. Then, in September\n1994 the company announced that, subject to market conditions, it\nplanned to repurchase 20 million shares of its common stock. That was\nmusic to Buffett’s ears.\nThat summer, Buffett had converted Berkshire’s holdings in preferred stock to common, and soon thereafter, he began to acquire even\nmore. By the end of the year, Berkshire owned 27 million shares. In\nMarch 1995, Buffett added another 20 million shares; in 1997, another\n49.5 million; and 50.5 million more in 1998. At the end of 2003, Berkshire owned more than 151 million shares of American Express stock,\nnearly 12 percent of the company, with a market value of more than $7\nbillion—seven times what Buffett paid for it.\nThe Washington Post Company\nThe Washington Post generates substantial cash f low for its owners, more\nthan can be reinvested in its primary businesses. So its management is\nconfronted with two rational choices: Return the money to shareholders\nand/or profitably invest the cash in new investment opportunities. As\nwe know, Buffett prefers to have companies return excess earnings to\nshareholders. The Washington Post Company, while Katherine Graham\nwas president, was the first newspaper company in its industry to repurchase shares in large quantities. Between 1975 and 1991, the company\nbought an unbelievable 43 percent of its shares at an average price of $60\nper share.\nA company can also choose to return money to shareholders by increasing the dividend. In 1990, confronted with substantial cash reserves,\nthe Washington Post voted to increase the annual dividend to its shareholders from $1.84 to $4.00, a 117 percent increase (see Figure 6.1).\nIn addition to returning excess cash to its owners, the Washington\nPost has made several profitable business purchases: cable properties from\nCapital Cities, cellular telephone companies, and television stations. Don\nGraham, who now runs the company, is continually beset with offers. To\nfurther his goal of developing substantial cash f lows at favorable investment costs, he has developed specific guidelines for evaluating those\noffers. He looks for a business that “has competitive barriers, does not require extensive capital expenditures, and has reasonable pricing power.”\nFurthermore, he notes, “we have a strong preference for businesses we\nknow” and given the choice, “we’re more likely to invest in a handful\nof big bets rather than spread our investment dollars around thinly.”9\nGraham’s acquisition approach mimics Buffett’s strategy at Berkshire\nHathaway.\nThe dynamics of the newspaper business have changed in recent\nyears. Earlier, when the economy slowed and advertisers cut spending,\nnewspapers could maintain profitability by raising lineage rates. But\ntoday’s advertisers have found cheaper ways to reach their customers:\ncable television, direct mail, and newspaper inserts. Newspapers are no\nlonger monopolies; they have lost their pricing f lexibility.\nEven so, Buffett is convinced that the Post is in better shape than\nother media companies. There are two reasons for his optimism. First,\nthe Post’s long-term debt was more than offset by its cash holdings.\nThe Washington Post is the only public newspaper that is essentially\nfree of debt. “As a result,” explains Buffett, “the shrinkage in the value\nof their assets has not been accentuated by the effects of leverage.”10\nSecond, he notes, the Washington Post Company has been exceptionally well managed.\nThe Pampered Chef\nDoris Christopher, the founder, chairman and CEO of the Pampered\nChef, has allocated her capital well—financing all expansion and growth\nthrough internal earnings. She has reinvested virtually all her profits\nin the company and the resulting expansion has brought tremendous\ngrowth in sales. Between 1995 and 2001, the Pampered Chef ’s business\ngrew an astonishing 232 percent, with pretax profit margins above 25\npercent. And the only debt the company ever had was the original $3,000\nseed money that Christopher borrowed from her life insurance policy.\nFrom all appearances, Doris Christopher is a careful and profitable\nmanager, and she runs a tight ship. She displays keen management intuition by treating her representatives well but competitively. The Pampered Chef ’s direct marketers across the country are the bread and butter\nof the business and the company’s only direct contact with its over 12\nmillion customers. The sales force earns commissions of 18 to 20 percent\non goods they sell, and 1 to 4 percent on the sales of kitchen consultants\nwhom they bring into the company.\nCANDOR\nBuffett holds in high regard managers who report their companies’ financial performance fully and genuinely, who admit mistakes as well as\nshare successes, and who are in all ways candid with shareholders. In\nparticular, he respects managers who are able to communicate the performance of their company without hiding behind Generally Accepted\nAccounting Principles (GAAP).\nFinancial accounting standards only require disclosure of business\ninformation classified by industry segment. Some managers exploit this\nminimum requirement and lump together all the company’s businesses\ninto one industry segment, making it difficult for owners to understand\nthe dynamics of their separate business interests.\n“What needs to be reported,” Buffett insists, “is data—whether\nGAAP, non-GAAP, or extra GAAP—that helps the financially literate\nreaders answer three key questions: (1) Approximately how much is\nthis company worth? (2) what is the likelihood that it can meet its future obligations? and (3) how good a job are its managers doing, given\nthe hand they have been dealt?”11\nBerkshire Hathaway’s own annual reports are a good example. They\nmeet GAAP obligations, but they go much further. Buffett includes the\nseparate earnings of each of Berkshire’s businesses and any other additional information that he feels owners would deem valuable when judging a company’s economic performance. Buffett admires CEOs who are\nable to report to their shareholders in the same candid fashion.\nHe also admires those with the courage to discuss failure openly.\nHe believes that managers who confess mistakes publicly are more\nlikely to correct them. According to Buffett, most annual reports are a\nsham. Over time, every company makes mistakes, both large and inconsequential. Too many managers, he believes, report with excess optimism instead of honest explanation, serving perhaps their own\ninterests in the short term but no one’s interests in the long run.\nBuffett credits Charlie Munger with helping him understand the\nvalue of studying one’s mistakes instead of concentrating only on success. In his annual reports to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Buffett\nis open about Berkshire’s economic and management performance,\nboth good and bad. Through the years, he has admitted the difficulties\nthat Berkshire encountered in both the textile and insurance businesses\nand his own management failures with these businesses.\nHis self-criticism is blunt, and unstinting. The merger with General\nRe reinsurance company in 1998 brought significant trouble, a good\ndeal of which remained undiagnosed for several years, and came to light\nonly in the wake of the World Trade Center bombing in 2001. At the\ntime of the merger, Buffett said later, he thought the reinsurance company operated with the same discipline he demanded of other Berkshire\ninsurance companies. “I was dead wrong,” he admitted in 2002. “There\nwas much to do at that company to get it up to snuff.”12\nThe General Re problem was not limited to its insurance practices.\nThe company also had a division that dealt in trading and derivatives, a\nbusiness Buffett considered unattractive at the time of the merger (although, as part of the package, unavoidable) and financially disastrous\nseveral years later. In 2003, he wrote this straightforward apology to\nshareholders: “I’m sure I could have saved you $100 million or so, if I had\nacted more promptly to shut down Gen Re Securities. Charlie would\nhave moved swiftly to close [it] down—no question about that. I, however, dithered. As a consequence, our shareholders are paying a far higher\nprice than was necessary to exit this business.”13\nCritics have argued that Buffett’s practice of publicly admitting his\nmistakes is made easier because, since he owns such a large share of\nBerkshire’s common stock, he never has to worry about being fired.\nThis is true. But it does not diminish the fundamental value of Buffett’s\nbelief that candor benefits the manager at least as much as it benefits the\nshareholder. “The CEO who misleads others in public,” he says, “may\neventually mislead himself in private.”14\nCoca-Cola\nRoberto Goizueta’s strategy for strengthening Coca-Cola when he took\nover as CEO pointedly included shareholders. “We shall, during the next\ndecade, remain totally committed to our shareholders and to the protection and enhancement of their investment,” he wrote. “In order to give\nour shareholders an above-average total return on their investment, we\nmust choose businesses that generate returns in excess of inf lation.”15\nGoizueta not only had to grow the business, which required capital\ninvestment, he was also obliged to increase shareholder value. By increasing profit margins and return on equity, Coca-Cola was able to increase dividends while simultaneously reducing the dividend payout\nratio. Dividends to shareholders, in the 1980s, were increasing 10 percent per year while the payout ratio was declining from 65 percent to 40\npercent. This enabled Coca-Cola to reinvest a greater percentage of the\ncompany’s earnings to help sustain its growth rate without shortchanging shareholders.\nCoca-Cola is undeniably a superior company with an outstanding\nhistorical economic performance record. In the most recent years, however, that level of growth has moderated. Where some shareholders\nmight have panicked, Buffett did not. He did not, in fact, do anything;\nhe didn’t sell even one share. It is a clear testament to his belief in the\ncompany, and a clear illustration of staying true to his principles.\nIf management stands to gain wisdom and credibility by facing mistakes,\nwhy do so many annual reports trumpet only successes? If allocation of\ncapital is so simple and logical, why is capital so poorly allocated? The\nanswer, Buffett has learned, is an unseen force he calls “the institutional\nimperative”—the lemminglike tendency of corporate management to\nimitate the behavior of other managers, no matter how silly or irrational\nthat behavior may be.\nHe says it was the most surprising discovery of his business career.\nAt school, he was taught that experienced managers were honest, intelligent, and automatically made rational business decisions. Once out in\nthe business world, he learned instead that “rationality frequently wilts\nwhen the institutional imperative comes into play.”16\nBuffett believes that the institutional imperative is responsible for\nseveral serious, but distressingly common, conditions: “(1) [The organization] resists any change in its current direction; (2) just as work expands to fill available time, corporate projects or acquisitions will\nmaterialize to soak up available funds; (3) any business craving of the\nleader, however foolish, will quickly be supported by detailed rate-ofreturn and strategic studies prepared by his troops; and (4) the behavior\nof peer companies, whether they are expanding, acquiring, setting executive compensation or whatever, will be mindlessly imitated.”17\nBuffett learned this lesson early. Jack Ringwalt, head of National\nIndemnity, which Berkshire acquired in 1967, helped Buffett discover\nthe destructive power of the imperative. While the majority of insurance companies were writing insurance policies on terms guaranteed to\nproduce inadequate returns or worse, a loss, Ringwalt stepped away\nfrom the market and refused to write new policies. (For the full story,\nrefer to Chapter 3.) Buffett recognized the wisdom of Ringwalt’s decisions and followed suit. Today, Berkshire’s insurance companies still\noperate on this principle.\nWhat is behind the institutional imperative that drives so many\nbusinesses? Human nature. Most managers are unwilling to look foolish and expose their company to an embarrassing quarterly loss when\nother “lemming” companies are still able to produce quarterly gains,\neven though they assuredly are heading into the sea. Shifting direction\nis never easy. It is often easier to follow other companies down the same\npath toward failure than to alter the direction of the company.\nAdmittedly, Buffett and Munger enjoy the same protected position\nhere as in their freedom to be candid about bad news: They don’t have to\nworry about getting fired, and this frees them to make unconventional\ndecisions. Still, a manager with strong communication skills should be\nable to convince owners to accept a short-term loss in earnings and a\nchange in the direction of their company if it means superior results over\ntime. Inability to resist the institutional imperative, Buffett has learned,\noften has less to do with the owners of the company than the willingness\nof its managers to accept fundamental change.\nEven when managers accept the notion that their company must\nradically change or face the possibility of shutting down, carrying out\nthis plan is too difficult for most managers. Many succumb to the\ntemptation to buy a new company instead of facing the financial facts of\nthe current problem.\nWhy would they do this? Buffett isolates three factors he feels most\ninf luence management’s behavior. First, most managers cannot control\ntheir lust for activity. Such hyperactivity often finds its outlet in business takeovers. Second, most managers are constantly comparing the\nsales, earnings, and executive compensation of their business with other\ncompanies in and beyond their industry. These comparisons invariably\ninvite corporate hyperactivity. Lastly, Buffett believes that most managers have an exaggerated sense of their own management capabilities.\nAnother common problem is poor allocation skills. As Buffett points\nout, CEOs often rise to their position by excelling in other areas of\nthe company, including administration, engineering, marketing, or production. Because they have little experience in allocating capital, most\nCEOs instead turn to their staff members, consultants, or investment\nbankers. Here the institutional imperative begins to enter the decisionmaking process. Buffett points out that if the CEO craves a potential acquisition requiring a 15 percent return on investment to justify the\npurchase, it is amazing how smoothly his troops report back to him that\nthe business can actually achieve 15.1 percent.\nThe final justification for the institutional imperative is mindless\nimitation. If companies A, B, and C are all doing the same thing, well\nthen, reasons the CEO of company D, it must be all right for our company to behave the same way.\nIt is not venality or stupidity, Buffett believes, that positions these\ncompanies to fail. Rather, it is the institutional dynamics of the imperative that make it difficult to resist doomed behavior. Speaking before a\ngroup of Notre Dame students, Buffett displayed a list of thirty-seven\nfailed investment banking firms. All of them, he explained, failed even\nthough the volume of the New York Stock Exchange had multiplied\nfifteenfold. These firms were headed by hard-working individuals with\nvery high IQs, all of whom had an intense desire to succeed. Buffett\npaused; his eyes scanned the room. “You think about that,” he said\nsternly. “How could they get a result like that? I’ll tell you how,” he\nsaid, “mindless imitation of their peers.”18\nCoca-Cola\nWhen Goizueta took over Coca-Cola, one of his first moves was to\njettison the unrelated businesses that the previous CEO had developed\nand return the company to its core business, selling syrup. It was a\nclear demonstration of Coca-Cola’s ability to resist the institutional\nimperative.\nReducing the company to a single-product business was undeniably a\nbold move. What made Goizueta’s strategy even more remarkable was\nhis willingness to take this action at a time when others in the industry\nwere doing the exact opposite. Several leading beverage companies were\ninvesting their profits in other unrelated businesses. Anheuser-Busch\nused the profits from its beer business to invest in theme parks. BrownForman, a producer and distributor of wine and spirits, invested its profits in china, crystal, silver, and luggage businesses, all of them with much\nlower returns. Seagram Company, Ltd., a global spirits and wine business, bought Universal Studios. Pepsi, Coca-Cola’s chief beverage rival,\nbought snack businesses (Frito-Lay) and restaurants including Taco Bell,\nKentucky Fried Chicken, and Pizza Hut.\nNot only did Goizueta’s action focus the company’s attention on its\nlargest and most important product, but it worked to reallocate the\ncompany’s resources into its most profitable business. Since the economic returns of selling syrup far outweighed the economic returns of\nthe other businesses, the company was now reinvesting its profits in its\nhighest-returning business.\nClayton Homes\nIn an industry that is strangled by problems of its own making, Clayton\nstands out for its strong management and smart business model.\nManufactured homes now constitute 15 percent of the total housing\nunits in the United States. In many respects, their historically negative\nimage is disappearing. The homes are becoming more like site-built\nhomes in size and scope; construction quality has consistently improved;\nthey are competitive with rentals; they have tax advantages in that owners do not have to own the underlying property; and mortgages are now\nsupported by other large mortgage companies and government agencies,\nsuch as Fannie Mae.\nStill, since they are considerably less expensive than site-built\nhomes (2002 average prices: $48,800 compared with $164,217), the\nprimary market remains consumers toward the lower end of the economic range. In 2002, over 22 million Americans lived in manufactured homes, with a median family income of $26,900.19\nMany manufacturers were caught in a self-inf licted double bind in\nthe 1990s, and many of them failed. One arm of this double bind was\nthe increasing acceptance and popularity of these homes, which rushed\nmany in the industry toward overexpansion. The other squeeze factor\nwas simple greed.\nThe homes are sold through retailers that are either independent\ndealers representing several manufacturers or company-owned outlets.\nRight there, on the same lot, shoppers usually find a financing operation, often a subsidiary of the manufacturer/retailer. In and of itself,\nthere is nothing wrong with this; it sounds like, and in fact operates\nlike, a car dealership. The problem is that it has become endemic in the\nindustry to push sales to anybody who can sign their name to a sales\nagreement, regardless of credit history, based on loans that are destined\nto default.\nSelling scads of units creates immediate profits for the retailers and\nhuge commissions for the salespeople. It also creates enormous economic\nproblems longer range. It is an unfortunate reality that many homes are\nsold to people with fragile economic circumstances, and repossession\nrates are high, which reduces the demand for new homes. As unemployment rates rose in the past few years, so did loan delinquencies. Factor in\nthe oversupply of inventory from the 1990s, and the tight economic\ntimes that diminished spending across the board, and it adds up to a\nsorry state of affairs for the industry as a whole.\nMuch of the problem can be traced to the very weak loans that are\nso common in the manufactured home business. Why do they all do it?\nBecause they all do it, and each company fears losing market share if it\ndoes otherwise. That, in a nutshell, is the curse of the institutional\nimperative. Clayton has not been completely immune, but it has\navoided the most egregious faults.\nMost importantly, Clayton compensates its salespeople in a different\nway. The commissions of sellers and managers are based not only on the\nnumber of homes sold but also on the quality and performance of the\nloans made. Sales staff share the financial burden when loan payments are\nmissed, and share the revenue when the loan performs well. Take, for example, a sales manager who handles the sale and financing of a $24,000\nmobile home. If the customer cannot make the payments, Clayton would\ntypically lose $2,500, and the manager is responsible for up to half the\nloss.20 But if the loan performs, the manager shares up to half of that, too.\nThat puts the burden to avoid weak loans on the sales personnel.\nThe methodology paid off: In 2002, “only 2.3 percent of the homeowners with a Clayton mortgage are 30 days delinquent.”21 That is\nroughly half the industry delinquency rate. In the late 1990s, when more\nthan 80 factories and 4,000 retailers went out of business, Clayton closed\nonly 31 retailers and did not shut any factories. By 2003, when Buffett\nentered the picture, Clayton had emerged from the downturn in the\neconomy in general and the mobile home industry in particular stronger\nand better positioned than any of its competitors.\nWarren Buffett bought Clayton Homes because he saw in Jim\nClayton a hardworking self-starter with strong management skills and a\nlot of smarts. Clayton showed not once but twice that he could weather\na downturn in the industry by structuring his business model in a way\nthat avoided an especially damaging institutional imperative.\nThe Washington Post Company\nBuffett has told us that even third-rate newspapers can earn substantial\nprofits. Since the market does not require high standards of a paper,\nit is up to management to impose its own. And it is management’s high\nstandards and abilities that can differentiate the business’s returns\nwhen compared with its peer group. In 1973, if Buffett had invested in\nGannett, Knight-Ridder, the New York Times, or Times Mirror the\nsame $10 million he did in the Post, his investment returns would have\nbeen above average, ref lecting the exceptional economics of the newspaper business during this period. But the extra $200-$300 million\nin market value that the Washington Post gained over its peer group,\nBuffett says, “came, in very large part, from the superior nature of the\nmanagerial decisions made by Kay [Katherine Graham] as compared to\nthose made by managers of most other media companies.”22\nKatherine Graham had the brains to purchase large quantities of the\nPost’s stock at bargain prices. She also had the courage, he said, to confront the labor unions, reduce expenses, and increase the business value\nof the paper. Washington Post shareholders are fortunate that Katherine\nGraham positioned the company so favorably.\nIn evaluating people, you look for three qualities: integrity,\nintelligence, and energy. If you don’t have the first, the other\ntwo will kill you.23\nWARREN BUFFETT, 1993\nIn all his communications with Berkshire shareholders, and indeed with\nthe world at large, Buffett has consistently emphasized his search for\nhonest and straightforward managers. He believes that not only are\nthese binding corporate values in today’s world, they are also pivotal issues that determine a company’s ultimate success and profitability in\nthe long term. Executive compensation, stock options, director independence, accounting trickery—these issues strike a very personal chord\nwith Buffett, and he does not hesitate to let us know how he feels.\nCEO Avarice and the Institutional Imperative\nIn his 2001 letter to shareholders, Buffett wrote, “Charlie and I are disgusted by the situation, so common in the last few years, in which shareholders have suffered billions in losses while the CEOs, promoters and\nother higher-ups who fathered these disasters have walked away with\nextraordinary wealth. Indeed, many of these people were urging investors to buy shares while concurrently dumping their own, sometimes\nusing methods that hid their actions. To their shame, these business leaders view shareholders as patsies, not partners. . . . There is no shortage of\negregious conduct in corporate America.”24\nThe accounting scandals set off alarm bells across the United States,\nespecially for anyone who held stock in a company 401(k) plan. Shareholders started asking questions and wondering if their companies were\nmanaging their affairs honestly and transparently. We all became increasingly aware that there were major problems in the system: CEOs\nwere getting huge paychecks while using company money for private\njets and ostentatious parties, and directors were often rubber-stamping\nwhatever decisions management decided to take. It seemed as if not one\nCEO could resist the temptation to get in on the enormous salaries and\nextravagant lifestyles enjoyed by others. That is the institutional imperative at its most destructive.\nThings have not improved much, according to Buffett. In his 2003\nletter to shareholders, he lambasted the seemingly unabated “epidemic of\ngreed.” He wrote, “Overreaching by CEOs greatly accelerated in the\n1990s as compensation packages gained by the most avaricious—a title\nfor which there was vigorous competition—were promptly replicated\nelsewhere. In judging whether Corporate America is serious about reforming itself, CEO pay remains the acid test. To date, the results aren’t\nencouraging.”25 This from a man who has no stock options and still pays\nhimself $100,000 a year.\nStock Options\nIn addition to these lofty salaries, executives of publicly traded companies are customarily rewarded with fixed-price stock options, often\ntied to corporate earnings but very seldom tied to the executive’s actual\njob performance.\nThis goes against the grain for Buffett. When stock options are\npassed out indiscriminately, he says, managers with below-average performance are rewarded just as generously as the managers who have had\nexcellent performance. In Buffett’s mind, even if your team wins the\npennant, you don’t pay a .350 hitter the same as a .150 hitter.\nAt Berkshire, Buffett uses a compensation system that rewards managers for performance. The reward is not tied to the size of the enterprise, the individual’s age, or Berkshire’s overall profits. Buffett believes\nthat good unit performance should be rewarded whether Berkshire’s\nstock price rises or falls. Instead, executives are compensated based on\ntheir success at meeting performance goals keyed to their area of responsibility. Some managers are rewarded for increasing sales, others for reducing expenses or curtailing capital expenditures. At the end of the\nyear, Buffett does not hand out stock options—he writes checks. Some\nare quite large. Managers can use the cash as they please. Many use it to\npurchase Berkshire stock.\nEven when stock options are treated as a legitimate aspect of executive compensation, Buffett cautions us to watch how they are accounted for on a company’s balance sheet. He believes they should be\nconsidered an expense so that their effect on reported earnings is clear.\nThis seems so obvious as to be unarguable; sadly, not all companies see\nit this way.\nIn Buffett’s mind, this is another facet of the ready acceptance of excessive pay. In his 2003 letter to shareholders, he wrote, “When CEOs\nor their representatives meet with compensation committees, too often\none side—the CEO’s—has cared far more than the other about what\nbargain is struck. A CEO, for example, will always regard the difference\nbetween receiving options for 100,000 shares or for 500,000 as monumental. To a comp committee, however, the difference may seem unimportant—particularly if, as has been the case at most companies, neither\ngrant will have any effect on reported earnings. Under these conditions,\nthe negotiation often has a ‘play money’ quality.”26\nBuffett’s strong feelings about this subject can be seen in his response to Amazon’s announcement in April 2003 that it would start expensing stock options. Buffett wrote to CEO Jeff Bezos that it took\n“particular courage” and his decision would be “recognized and remembered.”27 A week later, Buffett bought $98.3 million of Amazon’s\nhigh-yield bonds.\nMalfeasant Accounting and Shady Financing Issues\nAnyone who was reading a daily newspaper in the second half of 2001\ncould not help but be aware of the growing tide of corporate wrongdoing. For months, we all watched with something amounting to horror\nas one scandal followed another, involving some of the best-known\nnames in American industry. All came to be lumped under the umbrella\nterm “accounting scandal” because the misdeeds centered on accounting\ntrickery and because the outside auditors who were supposed to verify\nthe accounting reports were themselves named as parties to the actions.\nIn the long run, of course, trouble awaits managements that\npaper over operating problems with accounting maneuvers.28\nWARREN BUFFETT, 1991\nIt’s far broader than accounting, of course; it’s about greed, lies, and\ncriminal acts. But accounting reports are a good place to look for signs of\ntrouble. In his 2002 letter to shareholders, Buffett warned investors to be\ncareful in reading annual reports. “If you’ve been a reader of financial reports in recent years,” he wrote, “you’ve seen a f lood of ‘pro-forma’\nearnings statements—tabulations in which managers invariably show\n‘earnings’ far in excess of those allowed by their auditors. In these presentations, the CEO tells his owners don’t count this, don’t count that—\njust count what makes earnings fat.’ Often, a forget-all-this-bad-stuff\nmessage is delivered year after year without management so much as\nblushing.”29\nBuffett is plainly disgusted by the scandals. “The blatant wrongdoing\nthat has occurred has betrayed the trust of so many millions of shareholders.” He blames the heady days of the 1990s, the get-rich-quick period\nhe calls the Great Bubble, for the deterioration of corporate ethics. “As\nstock prices went up,” he says, “the behavioral norms of managers went\ndown. By the late 90s, CEOs who traveled the high road did not\nencounter heavy traffic. Too many have behaved badly, fudging numbers\nand drawing obscene pay for mediocre business achievements.”30 And\nin too many cases, their companies’ directors, charged with upholding\nshareholder interests, failed miserably.\nDirector Negligence and Corporate Governance\nPart of the problem, Buffett suggests, is the shameful tendency of\nboards of directors to blithely rubber-stamp whatever senior management asks for. It is a question of independence and guts—the degree to\nwhich directors are willing to honor their fiduciary responsibility at the\nrisk of displeasing the senior executives. That willingness, or lack of it,\nis on display in boardrooms across the country.\n“True independence—meaning the willingness to challenge a\nforceful CEO when something is wrong or foolish—is an enormously\nvaluable trait in a director,” Buffett writes. It is also rare. The place to\nlook for it is among high-grade people whose interests are in line with\nthose of rank and file shareholders.” Buffett illuminates his position by\ndescribing what he looks for in members of the Berkshire Hathaway\nboard—“very high integrity, business savvy, shareholder orientation\nand a genuine interest in the company.”31\nBuffett would be the first to admit that evaluating managers along his\nthree dimensions—rationality, candor, and independent thinking—is\nmore difficult than measuring financial performance, for the simple\nreason that human beings are more complex than numbers.\nIndeed, many analysts believe that because measuring human activity\nis vague and imprecise, we simply cannot value management with any\ndegree of confidence, and therefore the exercise is futile. Without a decimal point, they seem to suggest, there is nothing to measure. Others\nhold the view that the value of management is fully ref lected in the company’s performance statistics, including sales, profit margins, and return\non equity, and no other measuring stick is necessary.\nBoth opinions have some validity, but neither is strong enough to\noutweigh the original premise. The reason for taking the time to evaluate management is that it gives you early warning signs of eventual financial performance. If you look closely at the words and actions of a\nmanagement team, you will find clues that can help you measure the\nvalue of their work long before it shows up in the company’s financial\nreports or in the stock pages of your daily newspaper. Doing so will\ntake some digging on your part, and that may be enough to discourage\nthe weak of heart or the lazy. That is their loss, and your gain.\nHow to go about gathering the necessary information? Buffett offers\na few tips. He suggests reviewing annual reports from a few years back,\npaying special attention to what management said then about strategies\nfor the future. Then compare those plans to today’s results: How fully\nwere they realized? Also compare strategies of a few years ago to this\nyear’s strategies and ideas: How has the thinking changed? Buffett also\nsuggests that it can be very valuable to compare annual reports of the\ncompany you are interested in with reports from similar companies in\nthe same industry. It is not always easy to find exact duplicates, but even\nrelative performance comparison can yield insights.\nI read annual reports of the company I’m looking at and I read\nthe annual reports of the competitors. That’s the main source\nmaterial.\nWARREN BUFFETT, 1993\nWe like to keep things simple, so the chairman can sit around\nand read annual reports.32\nCHARLIE MUNGER, 1993\nExpand your reading horizons. Be alert for articles in newspapers\nand financial magazines about the company you are interested in and\nabout its industry in general. Read what the company’s executives have\nto say and what others say about them. If you notice that the chairman\nrecently made a speech or presentation, get a copy from the investor\nrelations department and study it carefully. Make use of the company’s\nweb pages for up-to-the-minute information. In every way you can\nthink of, raise your antennae. The more you develop the habit of staying\nalert for information, the easier the process will become.\nIt must be said here, with sadness, that it is possible that the documents you study are filled with inf lated numbers, half-truths, and deliberate obfuscations. We all know the names of the companies charged\nwith doing this; they are a rogue’s gallery of American businesses, and\nsome of their leaders are finding themselves with lots of time in prison\nto rethink their actions. Sometimes the manipulations are so skillful\nthat even forensic accountants are fooled; how then can you, an investor\nwithout any special knowledge, fully understand what you are seeing?\nThe regrettable answer is, you cannot. You can learn how to read\nannual reports and balance sheets—and you should—but if they are\nbased on f lagrant deception and lies, you might not be able to detect it.\nI do not mean to say that you should simply give up. Keep doing\nyour research, and strive to be alert for signs of trouble. It should not\nsurprise us that Warren Buffett gives us some valuable tips:33\n• “Beware of companies displaying weak accounting.” In particular, he cautions us to watch out for companies that do not expense\nstock options. It’s an obvious red f lag that other less obvious maneuvers are also present.\n• Another red f lag: unintelligible footnotes.” If you can’t understand them, he says, don’t assume it’s your shortcoming; it’s a favored tool for hiding something management doesn’t want you\nto know.\n• “Be suspicious of companies that trumpet earnings projections\nand growth expectations.” No one can know the future, and any\nCEO who claims to do so is not worthy of your trust.\nIn conclusion, Buffett wants to work with managers who are straight\nshooters, who are candid with their shareholders and their employees.\nHis unshakable insistence on ethical behavior as a condition of doing\nbusiness has taken on added significance since the outbreak of corporate\nscandals. However, he would be the first to acknowledge that taking\nsuch a stand will not, in and of itself, insulate investors from losses triggered by fraud.\nI must add my own caution: I cannot promise that following the\ntenets of the Warren Buffett Way described in this book will protect\nyou 100 percent. If company officials are f lat-out lying to investors\nthrough fraudulent accounting or other illegal maneuvers and if they’re\ngood at it, it can be difficult, often impossible, to detect in time. Eventually the perpetrators end up in jail, but by then the damage to shareholders is done; the money is gone. What I can say is this: If you adopt\nthe careful, thoughtful way of looking at investments that Buffett\nteaches us and take the time to do your homework, you will be right\nmore often than you are wrong, and certainly more often than those\nwho allow themselves to be pushed and pulled willy-nilly by headlines\nand rumor.",
    "Investing Guidelines: Financial Tenets": "The financial tenets by which Buffett values both managerial excellence and economic performance are all grounded in some typically Buffett-like principles. For one thing, he does not take yearly\nresults too seriously. Instead, he focuses on four- or five-year averages.\nOften, he notes, profitable business returns might not coincide with the\ntime it takes for the planet to circle the sun.\nHe also has little patience with accounting sleight-of-hand that produces impressive year-end numbers but little real value. Instead, he relies on a few timeless financial principles:\nFocus on return on equity, not earnings per share.\nCalculate “owner earnings” to get a true ref lection of value.\nLook for companies with high profit margins.\nFor every dollar retained, has the company created at least a dollar of market value?\nRETURN ON EQUITY\nCustomarily, analysts measure annual company performance by looking\nat earnings per share. Did they increase over the preceding year? Are\nthey high enough to brag about? For his part, Buffett considers earnings\nper share a smoke screen. Since most companies retain a portion of their\nprevious year’s earnings to increase their equity base, he sees no reason\nto get excited about record earnings per share. There is nothing spectacular about a company that increases earnings per share by 10 percent\nif at the same time it is growing its equity base by 10 percent. That’s no\ndifferent, he explains, from putting money in a savings account and letting the interest accumulate and compound.\nThe test of economic performance, Buffett believes, is whether a\ncompany achieves a high earnings rate on equity capital (“without undue\nleverage, accounting gimmickry, etc.”), not whether it has consistent\ngains in earnings per share.1 To measure a company’s annual performance, Buffett prefers return on equity—the ratio of operating earnings\nto shareholders’ equity.\nTo use this ratio, though, we need to make several adjustments. First,\nall marketable securities should be valued at cost and not at market value,\nbecause values in the stock market as a whole can greatly inf luence the\nreturns on shareholders’ equity in a particular company. For example, if\nthe stock market rose dramatically in one year, thereby increasing the net\nworth of a company, a truly outstanding operating performance would\nbe diminished when compared with a larger denominator. Conversely,\nfalling prices reduce shareholders’ equity, which means that mediocre\noperating results appear much better than they really are.\nSecond, we must also control the effects that unusual items may have\non the numerator of this ratio. Buffett excludes all capital gains and\nlosses as well as any extraordinary items that may increase or decrease\noperating earnings. He is seeking to isolate the specific annual performance of a business. He wants to know how well management accomplishes its task of generating a return on the operations of the business\ngiven the capital it employs. That, he says, is the single best measure of\nmanagement’s economic performance.\nFurthermore, Buffett believes that a business should achieve good\nreturns on equity while employing little or no debt. We know that\ncompanies can increase their return on equity by increasing their debtto-equity ratio. Buffett is aware of this, but the idea of adding a couple\nof points to Berkshire Hathaway’s return on equity simply by taking on\nmore debt does not impress him. “Good business or investment decisions,” he says, “will produce quite satisfactory economic results with\nno aid from leverage.”2 Furthermore, highly leveraged companies are\nvulnerable during economic slowdowns.\nBuffett does not give us any suggestions as to what debt levels are appropriate or inappropriate for a business. Different companies, depending\non their cash f lows, can manage different levels of debt. What Buffett\ndoes tell us is that a good business should be able to earn a good return on\nequity without the aid of leverage. Investors should be wary of companies\nthat can earn good returns on equity only by employing significant debt.\nCoca-Cola\nIn “Strategy for the 1980s,” his plan for revitalizing the company,\nGoizueta pointed out that Coca-Cola would divest any business that no\nlonger generated acceptable returns on equity. Any new business venture must have sufficient real growth potential to justify an investment.\nCoca-Cola was no longer interested in battling for share in a stagnant\nmarket. “Increasing earnings per share and effecting increased return\non equity are still the name of the game,” Goizueta announced.3 His\nwords were followed by actions. Coca-Cola’s wine business was sold to\nSeagram’s in 1983.\nAlthough the company earned a respectable 20 percent return on\nequity during the 1970s, Goizueta was not impressed. He demanded\nbetter returns and the company obliged. By 1988, Coca-Cola’s return\non equity had increased to 31.8 percent (see Figure 7.1).\nBy any measurement, Goizueta’s Coca-Cola was doubling and\ntripling the financial accomplishments of the previous CEO. The results\ncould be seen in the market value of the company. In 1980, Coca-Cola\nhad a market value of $4.1 billion. By the end of 1987, even after the\nstock market crash in October, the market value had risen to $14.1 billion (see Figure 7.2). In seven years, Coca-Cola’s market value rose at an\naverage annual rate of 19.3 percent.\nThe Washington Post Company\nWhen Buffett purchased stock in the Washington Post in 1973, its return on equity was 15.7 percent. This was an average return for most\nnewspapers and only slightly better than the Standard & Poor’s Industrial Index. But within five years, the Post’s return on equity doubled.\nBy then, it was twice as high as the S&P Industrials and 50 percent\nhigher than the average newspaper. Over the next ten years, the Post\nCompany maintained its supremacy, reaching a high of 36.3 percent return on equity in 1988.\nThese above-average returns are more impressive when you observe\nthat the company has, over time, purposely reduced its debt. In 1973,\nlong-term debt to shareholder’s equity stood at 37.2 percent, the second\nhighest ratio in the newspaper group. Astonishingly, by 1978, Katherine\nGraham had reduced the company’s debt by 70 percent. In 1983, longterm debt to equity was a low 2.7 percent—one-tenth the newspaper\ngroup average—yet the Post generated a return on equity 10 percent\nhigher than these same companies.\n“OWNER EARNINGS”\nInvestors, Buffett warns, should be aware that accounting earnings per\nshare represent the starting point for determining the economic value of\na business, not the ending point. “The first point to understand,” he says,\n“is that not all earnings are created equal.”4 Companies with high assets\nto profits, he points out, tend to report ersatz earnings. Because inf lation\nextracts a toll on asset-heavy businesses, the earnings of these businesses\ntake on a miragelike quality. Hence, accounting earnings are useful to the\nanalyst only if they approximate the expected cash f low of the company.\nBut even cash f low, Buffett warns, is not a perfect tool for measuring value; often it misleads investors. Cash f low is an appropriate way\nto measure businesses that have large investments in the beginning and\nsmaller outlays later on, such as real estate, gas fields, and cable companies. On the other hand, companies that require ongoing capital expenditures, such as manufacturers, are not accurately valued using only\ncash f low.\nA company’s cash f low is customarily defined as net income after\ntaxes plus depreciation, depletion, amortization, and other noncash\ncharges. The problem with this definition, Buffett explains, is that it\nleaves out a critical economic fact: capital expenditures. How much of\nthe year’s earnings must the company use for new equipment, plant upgrades, and other improvements to maintain its economic position and\nunit volume? According to Buffett, approximately 95 percent of U.S.\nbusinesses require capital expenditures that are roughly equal to their\ndepreciation rates. You can defer capital expenditures for a year or so, he\nsays, but if over a long period, you don’t make the necessary improvements, your business will surely decline. These capital expenditures are\nas much an expense to a company as are labor and utility costs.\nPopularity of cash-f low numbers heightened during the leveraged\nbuyout period of the 1980s because the exorbitant prices paid for businesses were justified by a company’s cash f low. Buffett believes that\ncash-f low numbers “are frequently used by marketers of business and\nsecurities to justify the unjustifiable and thereby sell what should be unsalable. When earnings look inadequate to service debt of a junk bond\nor justify a foolish stock price, how convenient it becomes to focus on\ncash f low.”5 But you cannot focus on cash f low, Buffett cautions, unless you are willing to subtract the necessary capital expenditures.\nInstead of cash f low, Buffett prefers to use what he calls “owner\nearnings”—a company’s net income plus depreciation, depletion, and\namortization, less the amount of capital expenditures and any additional working capital that might be needed. It is not a mathematically\nprecise measure, Buffett admits, for the simple reason that calculating\nfuture capital expenditures often requires rough estimates. Still, quoting Keynes, he says, “I would rather be vaguely right than precisely\nwrong.”\nCoca-Cola\nIn 1973, “owner earnings” (net income plus depreciation minus capital\nexpenditures) were $152 million. By 1980, owner earnings were $262\nmillion, an 8 percent annual compounded growth rate. Then from 1981\nthrough 1988, owner earnings grew from $262 million to $828 million,\na 17.8 percent average annual compounded growth rate (see Figure 7.3).\nThe growth in owner earnings is ref lected in the share price of\nCoca-Cola. In the ten-year period from 1973 to 1982, the total return\nof Coca-Cola grew at a 6.3 percent average annual rate. Over the next\nten years, from 1983 to 1992, the total return grew at an average annual rate of 31.1 percent.\nPROFIT MARGINS\nLike Philip Fisher, Buffett is aware that great businesses make lousy investments if management cannot convert sales into profits. In his experience, managers of high-cost operations tend to find ways that\ncontinually add to overhead, whereas managers of low-cost operations\nare always finding ways to cut expenses.\nBuffett has little patience for managers who allow costs to escalate. Frequently these same managers have to initiate a restructuring\nprogram to bring down costs in line with sales. Each time a company\nannounces a cost-cutting program, he knows this company has not figured out what expenses can do to a company’s owners. “The really\ngood manager,” Buffett says, “does not wake up in the morning and\nsay, ‘This is the day I’m going to cut costs,’ any more than he wakes up\nand decides to practice breathing.”6\nBuffett understands the right size staff for any business operation\nand believes that for every dollar of sales there is an appropriate level of\nexpenses. He has singled out Carl Reichardt and Paul Hazen at Wells\nFargo for their relentless attack on unnecessary expenses. They “abhor\nhaving a bigger head count than is needed,” he says, “and ‘Attack costs\nas vigorously when profits are at record levels as when they are under\npressure.’ ”7\nBuffett himself can be tough when it comes to costs and unnecessary\nexpenses, and he is very sensitive about Berkshire’s profit margins. Of\ncourse, Berkshire Hathaway is a unique corporation. The corporate staff\nat Kiewit Plaza would have difficulty fielding a softball team. Berkshire\nHathaway does not have a legal department, a public or investor relations department. There are no strategic planning departments staffed\nwith MBA-trained workers plotting mergers and acquisitions. The\ncompany’s aftertax overhead corporate expense runs less than 1 percent\nof operating earnings. Compare this, says Buffett, with other companies\nthat have similar earnings but 10 percent corporate expenses; shareholders lose 9 percent in the value of their holdings simply because of corporate overhead.\nThe Pampered Chef\nAs mentioned, Doris Christopher founded her company with $3,000\nborrowed against her family’s life insurance policy and she never took\non further debt. Today her company has over $700 million in sales.\nCustomers pay for products before delivery so the company is a cashpositive business. Alan Luce, president of Luce & Associates in Orlando,\nFlorida, a direct selling consulting firm, has estimated pretax profit margins at above 25 percent.\nCoca-Cola\nIn 1980, Coca-Cola’s pretax profit margins were a low 12.9 percent.\nMargins had been falling for five straight years and were substantially\nbelow the company’s 1973 margins of 18 percent. In Goizueta’s first\nyear, pretax margins rose to 13.7 percent; by 1988, when Buffett bought\nhis Coca-Cola shares, margins had climbed to a record 19 percent.\nThe Washington Post Company\nSix months after the Post Company went public in 1971, Katherine\nGraham met with Wall Street security analysts. The first order of business, she told them, was to maximize profits from the company’s existing operations. Profits continued to rise at the television stations and\nNewsweek, but profitability at the newspaper was leveling off. The primary reason, she said, was high production costs, namely wages.\nAfter the Post purchased the Times-Herald, profits at the company\nhad surged. Each time the unions struck the paper (1949, 1958, 1966,\n1968, 1969), management had opted to pay their demands rather than\nrisk a shutdown. During this time, Washington, DC, was still a threenewspaper town. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, increasing wage costs\ndampened profits. This problem, Mrs. Graham told the analysts, was\ngoing to be solved.\nAs union contracts began to expire in the 1970s, Mrs. Graham enlisted labor negotiators who took a hard line with the unions. In 1974,\nthe company defeated a strike by the Newspaper Guild and, after lengthy\nnegotiations, the printers settled on a new contract.\nIn the early 1970s, Forbes had written, “The best that could be said\nabout The Washington Post Company’s performance was it rated a gentleman’s C in profitability.”8 Pretax margins in 1973 were 10.8 percent—well below the company’s historical 15 percent margins earned\nin the 1960s. After the successful renegotiation of the union contracts,\nthe Post’s fortunes improved. By 1978, profit margins had leaped to\n19.3 percent—an 80 percent improvement within five years.\nBuffett’s bet had paid off. By 1988, the Post’s pretax margin reached\na high of 31.8 percent, which compared favorably with its newspaper\ngroup average of 16.9 percent and the Standard & Poor’s Industrial average of 8.6 percent. Although the company’s margins have declined somewhat in recent years, they remain substantially higher than the industry\naverage.\nTHE ONE-DOLLAR PREMISE\nBuffett’s goal is to select companies in which each dollar of retained\nearnings is translated into at least one dollar of market value. This test\ncan quickly identify companies whose managers, over time, have been\nable to optimally invest their company’s capital. If retained earnings are\ninvested in the company and produce above-average return, the proof\nwill be a proportionally greater rise in the company’s market value.\nIn time, that is. Although the stock market will track business value\nreasonably well over long periods, in any one year, prices can gyrate\nwidely for reasons other than value. The same is true for retained earnings, Buffett explains. If a company uses retained earnings unproductively over an extended period, eventually the market, justifiably, will\nprice its shares disappointingly. Conversely, if a company has been able\nto achieve above-average returns on augmented capital, the increased\nstock price will ref lect that success.\nBuffett believes that if he has selected a company with favorable longterm economic prospects run by able and shareholder-oriented managers,\nthe proof will be ref lected in the increased market value of the company.\nAnd he uses a quick test: The increased market value should at the very\nleast match the amount of retained earnings, dollar for dollar. If the value\nAs we have learned of one accounting scandal after another, it has\nbecome even more critical for investors to delve into these financial\nareas. There is no guarantee that through this effort you will fully uncover the truth, but you will have much greater chance of spotting\nphony numbers than if you do nothing. As Buffett remarks, “Managers\nthat always promise to ‘make the numbers will at some point make up\nthe numbers.”10 Your goal is to begin to learn to tell the difference.",
    "Investing Guidelines: Value Tenets": "All the principles embodied in the tenets described so far lead to\none decision point: buying or not buying shares in a company.\nAt that point, any investor must weigh two factors: Is this company a good value, and is this a good time to buy it—that is, is the\nprice favorable?\nThe stock market establishes price. The investor determines value\nafter weighing all the known information about a company’s business,\nmanagement, and financial traits. Price and value are not necessarily\nequal. As Warren Buffett often remarks, “Price is what you pay. Value\nis what you get.”\nIf the stock market were truly efficient, prices would instantaneously adjust to all available information. Of course, we know this\ndoes not occur. Stock prices move above and below company values for\nnumerous reasons, not all of them logical.\nIt’s bad to go to bed at night thinking about the price of a\nstock. We think about the value and company results; The\nstock market is there to serve you, not instruct you.1\nWARREN BUFFETT, 2003\nTheoretically, investors make their decisions based on the differences between price and value. If the price is lower than its per share\nvalue, a rational investor will decide to buy. If the price is higher than\nvalue, any reasonable investor will pass.\nAs the company moves through its economic life cycle, a savvy investor will periodically reassess the company’s value in relation to market price and will buy, sell, or hold shares accordingly.\nIn sum, then, rational investing has two components:\n1. Determine the value of the business.\n2. Buy only when the price is right—when the business is selling at\na significant discount to its value.\nThrough the years, financial analysts have used many formulas for determining the intrinsic value of a company. Some are fond of various\nshorthand methods: low price-to-earnings ratios, low price-to-book\nvalues, and high dividend yields. But the best system, according to Buffett, was determined more than sixty years ago by John Burr Williams.\nBuffett and many others use Williams’s dividend discount model, presented in his book The Theory of Investment Value,\nas the best way to determine the value of a security.\nParaphrasing Williams, Buffett tells us that the value of a business is\nthe total of the net cash f lows (owner earnings) expected to occur over\nthe life of the business, discounted by an appropriate interest rate. He\nconsiders it simply the most appropriate yardstick with which to measure a basket of different investment types: government bonds, corporate bonds, common stocks, apartment buildings, oil wells, and farms.\nThe mathematical exercise, Buffett tells us, is similar to valuing a\nbond. The bond market each day adds up the future coupons of a\nbond and discounts those coupons at the prevailing interest rate; that\ndetermines the value of the bond. To determine the value of a business, the investor estimates the “coupons” that the business will generate for a period into the future and then discounts all these coupons\nback to the present. “So valued,” Buffett says, “all businesses, from\nmanufacturers of buggy whips to operators of cellular telephones, become economic equals.2\nTo summarize, then, calculating the current value of a business\nmeans, first, estimating the total earnings that will likely occur over the\nlife of the business; and then discounting that total backward to today.\n(Keep in mind that for “earnings” Buffett uses owner earnings—net\ncash f low adjusted for capital expenditures, as described in Chapter 7.)\nTo estimate the total future earnings, we would apply all we had\nlearned about the company’s business characteristics, its financial\nhealth, and the quality of its managers, using the analysis principles described thus far. For the second part of the formula, we need only decide what the discount rate should be—more on that in a moment.\nBuffett is firm on one point: He looks for companies whose future\nearnings are as predictable, as certain, as the earnings of bonds. If the\ncompany has operated with consistent earnings power and if the business is simple and understandable, Buffett believes he can determine its\nfuture earnings with a high degree of certainty. If he is unable to project with confidence what the future cash f lows of a business will be, he\nwill not attempt to value the company. He’ll simply pass.\nTo properly value a business, you should ideally take all the\nf lows of money that will be distributed between now and judgment day and discount them at an appropriate discount rate.\nThat’s what valuing businesses is all about. Part of the equation\nis how confident you can be about those cash f lows occurring.\nSome businesses are easier to predict than others. We try to\nlook at businesses that are predictable.3\nWARREN BUFFETT, 1988\nThis is the distinction of Buffett’s approach. Although he admits\nthat Microsoft is a dynamic company and he regards Bill Gates highly\nas a manager, Buffett confesses he hasn’t a clue how to estimate the future cash earnings of this company. This is what he means by “the circle of competence”; he does not know the technology industry well\nenough to project the long-term earnings potential of any company\nwithin it.\nThis brings us to the second element in the formula: What is the\nappropriate discount rate? Buffett’s answer is simple: the rate that\nwould be considered risk-free. For many years, he used the rate then\ncurrent for long-term government bonds. Because the certainty that the\nU.S. government will pay its coupon over the next thirty years is virtually 100 percent, we can say that this is a risk-free rate.\nWhen interest rates are low, Buffett adjusts the discount rate upward. When bond yields dipped below 7 percent, Buffett upped his discount rate to 10 percent, and that is what he commonly uses today. If\ninterest rates work themselves higher over time, he has successfully\nmatched his discount rate to the long-term rate. If they do not, he has\nincreased his margin of safety by three additional points.\nSome academicians argue that no company, regardless of its\nstrengths, can assure future cash earnings with the same certainty as a\nbond. Therefore, they insist, a more appropriate discount factor would be\nthe risk-free rate of return plus an equity risk premium, added to ref lect\nthe uncertainty of the company’s future cash f lows. Buffett does not add\na risk premium. Instead, he relies on his single-minded focus on companies with consistent and predictable earnings and on the margin of\nsafety that comes from buying at a substantial discount in the first place.\n“I put a heavy weight on certainty,” Buffett says. “If you do that, the\nwhole idea of a risk factor doesn’t make any sense to me.”4\nCoca-Cola\nWhen Buffett first purchased Coca-Cola in 1988, people asked:\n“Where is the value in Coke?” Why was Buffett willing to pay five\ntimes book value for a company with a 6.6 percent earning yield? Because, as he continuously reminds us, price tells us nothing about value,\nand he believed Coca-Cola was a good value.\nTo begin with, the company was earning 31 percent return on equity while employing relatively little in capital investment. More important, Buffett could see the difference that Roberto Goizueta’s\nmanagement was making. Because Goizueta was selling off the poorperforming businesses and reinvesting the proceeds back into the\nhigher-performing syrup business, Buffett knew the financial returns\nof Coca-Cola were going to improve. In addition, Goizueta was buying\nback shares of Coca-Cola in the market, thereby increasing the economic value of the business even more. All this went into Buffett’s\nvalue calculation. Let’s walk through the calculation with him.\nIn 1988, owner earnings of Coca-Cola equaled $828 million. The\nthirty-year U.S. Treasury Bond (the risk-free rate) at that time traded\nnear a 9 percent yield. So Coca-Cola’s 1988 owner earnings, discounted\nby 9 percent, would produce an intrinsic value of $9.2 billion. When\nBuffett purchased Coca-Cola, the market value was $14.8 billion, 60\npercent higher, which led some observers to think he had overpaid. But\n$9.2 billion represents the discounted value of Coca-Cola’s thencurrent owner earnings. If Buffett was willing to pay the higher price,\nit had to be because he perceived that part of the value of Coca-Cola\nwas its future growth opportunities.\nWhen a company is able to grow owner earnings without additional capital, it is appropriate to discount owner earnings by the difference between the risk-free rate of return and the expected growth of\nowner earnings. Analyzing Coca-Cola, we find that owner earnings\nfrom 1981 through 1988 grew at a 17.8 percent annual rate—faster\nthan the risk-free rate of return. When this occurs, analysts use a twostage discount model. This model is a way of calculating future earnings\nwhen a company has extraordinary growth for a certain number of\nyears and then a period of constant growth at a slower rate.\nWe can use this two-stage process to calculate the 1988 present\nvalue of the company’s future cash f lows (see Table 8.1). First, assume\nthat starting in 1988, Coca-Cola would be able to grow owner earnings\nat 15 percent per year for ten years. This is a reasonable assumption,\nsince that rate is lower than the company’s previous seven-year average.\nBy the tenth year, the $828 million owner earnings that we started\nwith would have increased to $3.349 billion. Let’s further assume that\nstarting in the eleventh year, growth rate will slow to 5 percent a year.\nUsing a discount rate of 9 percent (the long-term bond rate at the\ntime), we can back-calculate the intrinsic value of Coca-Cola in 1988:\n$48.377 billion (see Notes section at the end of this book for details of\nthis calculation).5\nBut what happens if we decide to be more conservative, and use\ndifferent growth rate assumptions? If we assume that Coca-Cola can\ngrow owner earnings at 12 percent for ten years followed by 5 percent\ngrowth, the present value of the company discounted at 9 percent\nwould be $38.163 billion. At 10 percent growth for ten years and 5\npercent thereafter, the value of Coca-Cola would be $32.497 billion.\nAnd if we assume only 5 percent throughout, the company would still\nbe worth at least $20.7 billion [$828 million divided by (9−5 percent)].\nGillette\nBerkshire, as mentioned in Chapter 4, bought $600 million worth of\nconvertible preferred stock in July 1989. After a 2-for-1 stock split in\nFebruary 1991, Berkshire converted its preferred stock and received 12\nmillion common shares, 11 percent of Gillette’s shares outstanding.\nNow that Berkshire owned Gillette common yielding 1.7 percent\nversus the convertible preferred yielding 8.75 percent, its investment in\nGillette was no longer a fixed-income security with appreciation potential but a straight equity commitment. If Berkshire were to retain its\ncommon stock, Buffett needed to be convinced that Gillette was a good\ninvestment.\nWe already know that Buffett understood the company and that the\ncompany’s long-term prospects were favorable. Gillette’s financial characteristics, including return on equity and pretax margins, were improving. The ability to increase prices thereby boosting return on equity to\nabove-average rates signaled the company’s growing economic goodwill. CEO Mockler was purposefully reducing Gillette’s long-term debt\nand working hard to increase shareholder value.\nIn short, the company met all the prerequisites for purchase. What\nremained for Buffett was to determine the company’s value, to assure\nthat Gillette was not overpriced.\nGillette’s owner earnings at year-end 1990 were $275 million and\nhad grown at a 16 percent annual rate since 1987. Although this is too\nshort a period to fully judge a company’s growth, we can begin to\nmake certain assumptions. In 1991, Buffett compared Gillette to CocaCola. “Coca-Cola and Gillette are two of the best companies in the\nworld,” he wrote, “and we expect their earnings to grow at hefty rates\nin the years ahead.”6\nIn early 1991, the thirty-year U.S. government bond was trading at\nan 8.62 percent yield. To be conservative, we can use a 9 percent discount rate to value Gillette. But like Coca-Cola, Gillette’s potential\ngrowth of earnings exceeds the discount rate, so again we must use the\ntwo-stage discount model. If we assume a 15 percent annual growth for\nten years and 5 percent growth thereafter, discounting Gillette’s 1990\nowner earnings at 9 percent, the approximate value of Gillette is $16\nbillion. If we adjust the future growth rate downward to 12 percent,\nthe value is approximately $12.6 billion; at 10 percent growth, the\nvalue would be $10.8 billion. At a very conservative 7 percent growth\nin owner earnings, the value of Gillette is at least $8.5 billion.\nThe Washington Post Company\nIn 1973, the total market value for the Washington Post was $80 million.\nYet Buffett claims that “most security analysts, media brokers, and media\nexecutives would have estimated WPC’s intrinsic value at $400 to $500\nmillion.”7 How did Buffett arrive at that estimate? Let us walk through\nthe numbers, using Buffett’s reasoning.\nWe’ll start by calculating owner earnings for that year: Net income\n($13.3 million) plus depreciation and amortization ($3.7 million) minus\ncapital expenditures ($6.6 million) yields 1973 owner earnings of $10.4\nmillion. If we divide these earnings by the long-term U.S. government\nbond yield at the time (6.81 percent), the value of the Washington Post\nreaches $150 million, almost twice the market value of the company but\nwell short of Buffett’s estimate.\nBuffett tells us that, over time, the capital expenditures of a newspaper will equal depreciation and amortization charges, and therefore\nnet income should approximate owner earnings. Knowing this, we can\nsimply divide net income by the risk-free rate and thus reach a valuation\nof $196 million.\nIf we stop here, the assumption is that the increase in owner earnings will equal the rise in inf lation. But we know that newspapers have\nunusual pricing power: Because most are monopolies in their community, they can raise their prices at rates higher than inf lation. If we\nmake one last assumption—that the Washington Post has the ability to\nraise real prices by 3 percent—the value of the company is closer to\n$350 million. Buffett also knew that the company’s 10 percent pretax\nmargins were below its 15 percent historical average margins, and he\nknew that Katherine Graham was determined that the Post would once\nagain achieve these margins. If pretax margins improved to 15 percent,\nthe present value of the company would increase by $135 million,\nbringing the total intrinsic value to $485 million.\nWells Fargo\nThe value of a bank is the function of its net worth plus its projected\nearnings as a going concern. When Berkshire Hathaway began purchasing Wells Fargo in 1990, the company in the previous year had earned\n$600 million. The average yield on the thirty-year U.S. government\nbond that year was approximately 8.5 percent. To remain conservative,\nwe can discount Wells Fargo’s 1989 $600 million earnings by 9 percent\nand value the bank at $6.6 billion. If the bank never earned another\ndime over $600 million a year for the next thirty years, it was worth at\nleast $6.6 billion. When Buffett purchased Wells Fargo in 1990, he paid\n$58 per share for its stock. With 52 million shares outstanding, this was\nequivalent to paying $3 billion for the company—a 55 percent discount\nto its value.\nThe debate in investment circles at the time centered on whether\nWells Fargo, after taking into consideration all its loan problems, even\nhad earnings power. The short sellers said it no; Buffett said yes. He\nknew full well that ownership of Wells Fargo carried some risk, but he\nfelt confident in his analysis. His step-by-step thinking is a good model\nfor everyone weighing the risk factor of an investment.\nHe started with what he already knew. Carl Reichardt, then chairman of Wells Fargo, had run the bank since 1983, with impressive results. Under his leadership, growth in earnings and return on equity\nwere both above average and operating efficiencies were among the\nhighest in the country. Reichardt had also built a solid loan portfolio.\nNext, Buffett envisioned the events that would endanger the investment and came up with three possibilities, then tried to imagine\nthe likelihood that they would occur. It is, in a real sense, an exercise in\nprobabilities.\nThe first possible risk was a major earthquake, which would\n“wreak havoc” on borrowers and in turn on their lenders. The second\nrisk was broader: a “systemic business contraction or financial panic so\nsevere it would endanger almost every highly leveraged institution, no\nmatter how intelligently run.” Neither of those two could be ruled out\nentirely, of course, but Buffett concluded, based on best evidence, that\nthe probability of either one was low.\nThe third risk, and the one getting the most attention from the\nmarket at the time, was that real estate values in the West would tumble\nbecause of overbuilding and “deliver huge losses to banks that have financed the expansion.”8 How serious would that be?\nBuffett reasoned that a meaningful drop in real estate values should\nnot cause major problems for a well-managed bank like Wells Fargo.\n“Consider some mathematics,” he explained. Buffett knew that Wells\nFargo earned $1 billion pretax annually after expensing an average\n$300 million for loan losses. He figured if 10 percent of the bank’s $48\nbillion in loans—not just commercial real estate loans but all the bank’s\nloans—were problem loans in 1991 and produced losses, including interest, averaging 30 percent of the principal value of the loan, Wells\nFargo would still break even.\nIn Buffett’s judgment, the possibility of this occurring was low. But\neven if Wells Fargo earned no money for a year, but merely broke even,\nBuffett would not f linch. “A year like that—which we consider only a\nlow-level possibility, not a likelihood—would not distress us.”9\nThe attraction of Wells Fargo intensified when Buffett was able to\npurchase shares at a 50 percent discount to their value. His bet paid off.\nBy the end of 1993, Wells Fargo’s share price reached $137 per share,\nnearly triple what Buffett originally paid.\nFocusing on businesses that are understandable, with enduring economics, run by shareholder-oriented managers—all those characteristics are important, Buffett says, but by themselves will not guarantee\ninvestment success. For that, he first has to buy at sensible prices, and\nthen the company has to perform to his business expectations. The second is not always easy to control, but the first is: If the price isn’t satisfactory, he passes.\nBuffett’s basic goal is to identify businesses that earn above-average\nreturns, and then to purchase these businesses at prices below their\nindicated value. Graham taught Buffett the importance of buying a\nstock only when the difference between its price and its value represents\na margin of safety. Today, this is still his guiding principle, even though\nhis partner Charlie Munger has encouraged him toward occasionally\npaying more for outstanding companies.\nGreat investment opportunities come around when excellent\ncompanies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause\nthe stock to be misappraised.10\nWARREN BUFFETT, 1988\nThe margin-of-safety principle assists Buffett in two ways. First, it\nprotects him from downside price risk. If he calculates that the value of\na business is only slightly higher than its per share price, he will not buy\nthe stock. He reasons that if the company’s intrinsic value were to dip\neven slightly, eventually the stock price would also drop, perhaps below\nwhat he paid for it. But when the margin between price and value is\nlarge enough, the risk of declining value is less. If Buffett is able to purchase a company at 75 percent of its intrinsic value (a 25 percent discount) and the value subsequently declines by 10 percent, his original\npurchase price will still yield an adequate return.\nThe margin of safety also provides opportunities for extraordinary\nstock returns. If Buffett correctly identifies a company with aboveaverage economic returns, the value of its stock over the long term will\nsteadily march upward. If a company consistently earns 15 percent on\nequity, its share price will appreciate more each year than that of a company that earns 10 percent on equity. Additionally, if Buffett, by using\nthe margin of safety, is able to buy this outstanding business at a significant discount to its intrinsic value, Berkshire will earn an extra bonus\nwhen the market corrects the price of the business. “The market, like the\nLord, helps those who help themselves,” says Buffett. “But unlike the\nLord, the market does not forgive those who know not what they do.”11\nCASE IN POINT\nLARSON-JUHL, 2001\nLate in 2001, Warren Buffett made a handshake deal to buy\nLarson-Juhl, wholesale supplier of custom picture-framing\nmaterials, for $223 million in cash. It was Buffett’s favorite\nscenario: a solid company, with good economics, strong management, and an excellent reputation in its industry, but experiencing a short-term slump that created an attractive price.\nThe business was owned 100 percent by Craig Ponzio, a\ntalented designer with an equal talent for business. While in\ncollege, he worked for one of the manufacturing facilities of\nLarson Picture Frame, then ended up buying the company in\n1981. Seven years later, he bought competitor Juhl-Pacific, creating the company now known as Larson-Juhl. When Ponzio\nbought Larson in 1981, its annual sales were $3 million; in\n2001, Larson-Juhl’s sales were more than $300 million.\nThat is the kind of performance that Buffett admires.\nHe also admires the company’s operating structure. LarsonJuhl manufactures and sells the materials that custom framing\nshops use: fancy moldings for frames, matboard, glass, and assorted hardware. The local shops display samples of all the\nframe moldings available, but keep almost none of it in inventory. When a customer picks out a frame style, the shop must\norder the molding stock. And this is where Larson-Juhl shines.\nThrough its network of twenty-three manufacturing and distribution facilities scattered across the United States, it is able\nto fill orders in record time. In the great majority of cases—industry analysts say as much as 95 percent of the time—materials are received the next day.\nWith that extraordinary level of service, very few shops are\ngoing to change suppliers, even if the prices are higher. And\nthat gives Larson-Juhl what Buffett calls a moat—a clear and\nsustainable edge over competitors.\nFurther strengthening that moat, Larson-Juhl is widely\nknown as the class act in molding. Frame shop operators order\nmolding material in one-foot increments, and then cut it to the\nexact size needed for the customer’s project. If the molding\nsplits or does not cut cleanly, they cannot achieve the tight corners that they pride themselves on. Larson-Juhl molding, they\nsay, makes perfect corners every time. That reputation for\nquality has made Larson-Juhl not only the largest but also the\nmost prestigious company in its industry.\nLarson-Juhl sells thousands of framing styles and finishes to\nits more than 18,000 customers. The leading supplier in the\nUnited States, it also operates thirty-three facilities in Europe,\nAsia, and Australia.\nIn sum, Larson-Juhl has many of the qualities Buffett looks\nfor. The business is simple and understandable, and the company has a long and consistent history; one of the original component companies dates back 100 years. It also has a predictable\nfuture, with favorable long-term prospects. The ingredients of\ncustom framing—molding, glass, mats—are not likely to be\nmade obsolete by changes in technology, nor is customer demand for special treatment of favorite art likely to disappear.\nWhat piqued Buffett’s interest at this particular time, however, was the opportunity to acquire the company at an attractive price, triggered by a dip in profitability that he believed\nwas temporary.\nIn fiscal 2001 (which ended in August), Larson-Juhl had\n$314 million in net sales and $30.8 million in cash from operations. That was down somewhat from prior years: $361 million\nsales and $39.1 million cash in 2000; $386 million in sales in\n1999. Knowing Buffett’s general approach to calculating value,\nwe can make a good guess at his financial analysis of LarsonJuhl. Using his standard 10 percent dividend discount rate, adjusted for a very reasonable 3 percent growth rate, the company\nwould have had a value of $440 million in 2001 ($30.8 million\ndivided by [10 minus 3 percent]). So the $223 million purchase\nprice represented a very good value. Also, Buffett was convinced the fundamental economics of the company were sound,\nand that the lower numbers were a short-term response to the\ndepressed economy at the time.\nAs is so often the case, Larson-Juhl approached Berkshire,\nnot the other way around. Buffett describes the conversation:\n“Though I had never heard of Larson-Juhl before Craig’s call, a\nfew minutes talk with him made me think we would strike a\ndeal. He was straightforward in describing the business, cared\nabout who bought it, and was realistic as to price. Two days\nlater, Craig and Steve McKenzie, his CEO, came to Omaha and\nin ninety minutes we reached an agreement.”12 From first contact to signed contract, the deal took just twelve days.\nCoca-Cola\nFrom the time that Roberto Goizueta took control of Coca-Cola in\n1980, the company’s stock price had increased every year. In the five\nyears before Buffett purchased his first shares, the price increased an average of 18 percent every year. The company’s fortunes were so good\nthat Buffett was unable to purchase any shares at distressed prices. Still,\nhe charged ahead. Price, he reminds us, has nothing to do with value.\nIn June 1988, the price of Coca-Cola was approximately $10 per\nshare (split-adjusted). Over the next ten months, Buffett acquired\n93,400,000 shares, at an average price of $10.96—fifteen times earnings,\ntwelve times cash f low, and five times book value. He was willing to do\nthat because of Coke’s extraordinary level of economic goodwill, and because he believed the company’s intrinsic value was much higher.\nThe stock market’s value of Coca-Cola in 1988 and 1989, during\nBuffett’s purchase period, averaged $15.1 billion. But Buffett was convinced its intrinsic value was higher—$20 billion (assuming 5 percent\ngrowth), $32 billion (assuming 10 percent growth), $38 billion (at 12\npercent growth), perhaps even $48 billion (if 15 percent growth). Therefore Buffett’s margin of safety—the discount to intrinsic value—could\nbe as low as a conservative 27 percent or as high as 70 percent. At the\nsame time, his conviction about the company had not changed: The\nprobabilities of Coca-Cola’s share price beating the market rate of return\nwere going up, up, and up (see Figure 8.1)\nSo what did Buffett do? Between 1988 and 1989, Berkshire Hathaway purchased more than $1 billion of Coca-Cola stock, representing\n35 percent of Berkshire’s common stock portfolio. It was a bold move.\nIt was Buffett acting on one of his guiding principles: When the probabilities of success are very high, make a big bet.\nGillette\nFrom 1984 through 1990, the average annual gain in Gillette’s share\nwas 27 percent. In 1989, the share price gained 48 percent and in 1990,\nthe year before Berkshire converted its preferred stock to common,\nGillette’s share price rose 28 percent (see Figure 8.2). In February\n1991, Gillette’s share price reached $73 per share (presplit), then a\nrecord high. At that time, the company had 97 million shares outstanding. When Berkshire converted, total shares increased to 109 million.\nGillette’s stock market value was $8.03 billion.\nDepending on your growth assumptions for Gillette, at the time of\nconversion the market price for the company was at a 50 percent discount\nto value (15 percent growth in owner earnings), a 37 percent discount\n(12 percent growth), or a 25 percent discount (10 percent growth).\nThe Washington Post Company\nEven the most conservative calculation of value indicates that Buffett\nbought the Washington Post Company for at least half of its intrinsic\nvalue. He maintains that he bought the company at less than onequarter of its value. Either way, Buffett satisfied Ben Graham’s premise\nthat buying at a discount creates a margin of safety.\nThe Pampered Chef\nIt is reported that Buffett bought a majority stake in the Pampered Chef\nfor somewhere between $800,000 and $900,000. With pretax margins\nof 20 to 25 percent, this means that the Pampered Chef was bought at a\nmultiple of 4.3 times to 5 times pretax income and 6.5 times to 7.5\ntimes net income, assuming full taxable earnings.\nWith revenue growth of 25 percent or above and net income that\nconverts into cash at anywhere from a high fraction of earnings to a\nmultiple of earnings, and with a very high return on capital, there is no\ndoubt that the Pampered Chef was purchased at a significant discount.\nCASE IN POINT FRUIT OF THE LOOM, 2002\nIn 2001, while Fruit of the Loom was operating under the supervision of the bankruptcy court, Berkshire Hathaway offered\nto purchase the apparel part of the company (its core business)\nfor $835 million in cash. As part of its bankruptcy agreement,\nFruit of the Loom was required to conduct an auction for competitive offers. In January 2002, the court announced that Berkshire was the successful bidder, with the proceeds of the sale to\ngo to creditors.\nAt the time of Berkshire’s offer, Fruit of the Loom had a\ntotal debt of about $1.6 billion—$1.2 billion to secured lenders\nand bondholders and $400 million to unsecured bondholders.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, secured creditors received\nan estimated 73 cents on the dollar for their claims, unsecured\ncreditors about 10 cents.\nJust before filing for bankruptcy in 1999, the company had\n$2.35 billion in assets, then lost money during reorganization.\nAs of October 31, 2000, assets were $2.02 billion.\nSo, in simplified terms, Buffett bought a company with $2\nbillion in assets for $835 million, which went to pay the outstanding debt of $1.6 billion.\nBut there was a nice kicker. Soon after Fruit of the Loom\nwent bankrupt, Berkshire bought its debt ( both bonds and bank\nloans) for about 50 percent of face value. Throughout the bankruptcy period, interest payments on senior debt continued, earning Berkshire a return of about 15 percent. In effect, Buffett had\nbought a company that owed him money, and repaid it. As\nBuffett explained it, “Our holdings grew to 10 percent of Fruit’s\nsenior debt, which will probably end up returning us about\n70 percent of face value. Through this investment, we indirectly\nreduced our purchase price for the whole company by a small\namount.”13\nWarren Buffett is one of the few people who could characterize $105 million as a “small amount,” but, in fact, after taking into account these interest payments, the net purchase price\nfor the company was $730 million.\nAt the time Berkshire’s offer was being reviewed by the\nbankruptcy court, a reporter for the Omaha World-Herald\nasked Travis Pascavis, a Morningstar analyst, about the deal. He\nnoted that companies like Fruit of the Loom usually sell for\ntheir book value, which in this case would have been $1.4 billion. So with a bid of $835 million (ultimately, $730 million),\nBerkshire would be getting the company for a bargain price.14\nClayton Homes\nBerkshire’s purchase of Clayton was not all smooth sailing; a legal battle erupted over the selling price.\nAt $12.50 per share, Buffett’s April 2003 offer for Clayton was at\nthe low end of the $11.49 to $15.58 range that bankers had assigned to\nthe shares a month earlier. Clayton management argued that the deal\nwas fair considering the industry’s slump at the time. But Clayton\nshareholders mounted a battle in the courts, saying that Berkshire’s offer\nwas far below the real value of Clayton’s shares. James J. Dorr, general\ncounsel for Orbis Investment Management Ltd., which voted its 5.4\npercent stake against the merger, grumbled, “The fact that it’s Warren\nBuffett who wants to buy from you should tell you that you shouldn’t\nsell, at least not at his price.”15 For a value investor, that is probably a\nvery high compliment.\nWarren Buffett defended his offer. At the time of the shareholder\nvote, he wrote, the mobile home business was in bad shape and companies such as Clayton, which needs at least $1 billion of financing\neach year and faces declining sales, would continue to have a hard time\nfinding funds.” Clayton’s board apparently agreed. Then, as evidence\nof his commitment to Clayton, Buffett added that he had advanced\nthe company $360 million of financing since his offer.16 Buffett and\nClayton management ended up winning the shareholder battle by a\nnarrow margin.\nPUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER\nWarren Buffett has said more than once that investing in stocks is really\nsimple: Find great companies that are run by honest and competent\npeople and are selling for less than they are intrinsically worth. No\ndoubt many who have heard and read that remark over the years have\nthought to themselves, “Sure, simple if you’re Warren Buffett. Not so\nsimple for me.”\nBoth sentiments are true. Finding those great companies takes time\nand effort, and that is never easy. But the next step—determining their\nreal value so you can decide whether the price is right—is a simple matter of plugging in the right variables. And that is where the investment\ntenets described in these chapters will serve you well:\n• The business tenets will keep you focused on companies that are\nrelatively predictable. If you stick to those with a consistent operating history and favorable prospects, producing basically the\nsame products for the same markets, you will develop a sense of\nhow they will do in the future. The same is true if you concentrate on businesses that you understand; if not, you won’t be able\nto interpret the impact of new developments.\n• The management tenets will keep you focused on companies that\nare well run. Excellent managers can make all the difference in a\ncompany’s future success.\n• Together, the business and management tenets will give a good\nsense of the company’s future earnings potential.\n• The financial tenets will reveal the numbers you need to make a\ndetermination of the company’s real value.\n• The value tenets will take you through the mathematics necessary to come up with a final answer: Based on everything you\nhave learned, is this a good buy?\nThe two value tenets are crucial. But don’t worry too much if you\nare unable to address the other ten fully. Don’t let yourself become paralyzed by too much information. Do the best you can, get started, and\nkeep moving forward.",
    "Investing in Fixed-Income Securities": "Warren Buffett is perhaps best known in the investment world\nfor his decisions in common stocks, and he is famous for his\n“buy and hold” positions in companies such as Coca-Cola,\nAmerican Express, the Washington Post, and Gillette. His activities are\nnot, however, limited to stocks. He also buys short-term and long-term\nfixed-income securities, a category that includes cash, bonds, and preferred stocks. In fact, fixed-income investing is one of Buffett’s regular\noutlets, provided—as always—that there are undervalued opportunities. He simply seeks out, at any given time, those investments that\nprovide the highest aftertax return. In recent years, this has included\nforays into the debt market, including corporate and government\nbonds, convertible bonds, convertible preferred stock, and even highyielding junk bonds.\nWhen we look inside these fixed-income transactions, what we see\nlooks familiar, for Buffett has displayed the same approach that he takes\nwith investments in stocks. He looks for margin of safety, commitment,\nand low prices ( bargains). He insists on strong and honest management,\ngood allocation of capital, and a potential for profit. His decisions do\nnot depend on hot trends or market-timing factors but instead are savvy\ninvestments based on specific opportunities where Buffett believes there\nare undervalued assets or securities.\nThis aspect of Buffett’s investing style doesn’t receive a great deal of\nattention in the financial press, but it is a critical part of the overall Berkshire portfolio. Fixed-income securities represented 20 percent of Berkshire’s investment portfolio in 1992; today, 14 years later, that percentage\nhas grown to about 30 percent.\nThe reason for adding these fixed-income investments is simple:\nThey were the best value at the time. Because of the absolute growth of\nthe Berkshire Hathaway portfolio and the changing investment environment, including a lack of publicly traded stocks that he finds attractive,\nBuffett has often turned to buying entire companies and to acquiring\nfixed-income securities. He wrote in his 2003 letter to shareholders that\nit was hard to find significantly undervalued stocks, “a difficulty greatly\naccentuated by the mushrooming of the funds we must deploy.”\nIn that same 2003 letter, Buffett explained that Berkshire would\ncontinue the capital allocation practices it had used in the past: “If stocks\nbecome cheaper than entire businesses, then we will buy them aggressively. If selected bonds become attractive, as they did in 2002, we will\nagain load up on these securities. Under any market or economic conditions we will be happy to buy businesses that meet our standards. And,\nfor those that do, the bigger, the better. Our capital is underutilized\nnow. It is a painful condition to be in but not as painful as doing something stupid. (I speak from experience.)”1\nTo some extent, fixed-income investments will always be necessary\nfor Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio because of Berkshire’s concentration\nin insurance companies. To fulfill their obligation to policyholders,\ninsurance companies must invest some of their assets in fixed-income\nsecurities. Still, Berkshire holds a significantly smaller percentage of\nfixed-income securities in its insurance investment portfolio compared\nwith other insurance companies.\nGenerally speaking, Buffett has tended to avoid fixed-income investments (outside what was needed for the insurance portfolios) whenever\nhe feared impending inf lation, which would erode the future purchasing\npower of money and therefore the value of bonds. Even though interest\nrates in the late 1970s and early 1980s approximated the returns of most\nbusinesses, Buffett was not a net purchaser of long-term bonds. There always existed, in his mind, the possibility of runaway inf lation. In that\nkind of environment, common stocks would have lost real value, but\nbonds outstanding would have suffered far greater losses. An insurance\ncompany heavily invested in bonds in a hyperinf lationary environment\nhas the potential to wipe out its portfolio.\nEven though thinking of Buffett and bonds in the same sentence may\nbe a new idea for you, it will come as no surprise that he applies the same\nprinciples as he does in valuing a company or stocks. He is a principlebased investor who will put his money in a deal where he sees a potential\nfor profit, and he makes sure that the risk is priced into the deal. Even in\nfixed-income transactions, his business owner’s perspective means that\nhe pays close attention to the issuing company’s management, values, and\nperformance. This “bond-as-a-business” approach to fixed-income investing is highly unusual but it has served Buffett well.\nBONDS\nWashington Public Power Supply System\nBack in 1983, Buffett decided to invest in some bonds of the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS). The transaction is a clear\nexample of Buffett’s thinking in terms of the possible gains from buying the bonds compared with those if he bought the entire company.\nOn July 25, 1983, WPPSS (pronounced, with macabre humor,\n“Whoops”) announced that it was in default of $2.25 billion in municipal bonds used to finance the uncompleted construction of two nuclear\nreactors, known as Projects 4 and 5. The state ruled that the local power\nauthorities were not obligated to pay WPPSS for power they had previously promised to buy but ultimately did not require. That decision led\nto the largest municipal bond default in U.S. history. The size of the\ndefault and the debacle that followed depressed the market for public\npower bonds for several years. Investors moved quickly to sell their utility bonds, forcing prices lower and current yields higher.\nThe cloud over WPPSS Projects 4 and 5 cast a shadow over Projects\n1, 2, and 3. But Buffett perceived significant differences between the\nterms and obligations of Projects 4 and 5 on the one hand and those of\nProjects 1, 2, and 3 on the other. The first three were operational utilities that were also direct obligations of Bonneville Power Administration,\na government agency. However, the problems of Projects 4 and 5 were\nso severe that some were predicting they could weaken the credit position of Bonneville Power.\nBuffett evaluated the risks of owning municipal bonds of WPPSS\nProjects 1, 2, and 3. Certainly there was a risk that these bonds could\ndefault and a risk that the interest payments could be suspended for a\nprolonged period. Still another factor was the upside ceiling on what\nthese bonds could ever be worth. Even though he could purchase these\nbonds at a discount to their par value, at the time of maturity they\ncould only be worth one hundred cents on the dollar.\nShortly after Projects 4 and 5 defaulted, Standard & Poor’s suspended\nits ratings on Projects 1, 2, and 3. The lowest coupon bonds of Projects 1,\n2, and 3 sank to forty cents on the dollar and produced a current yield of\n15 to 17 percent tax-free. The highest coupon bonds fell to eighty cents\non the dollar and generated a similar yield. Undismayed, from October\n1983 through June the following year, Buffett aggressively purchased\nbonds issued by WPPSS for Projects 1, 2, and 3. By the end of June\n1984, Berkshire Hathaway owned $139 million of WPPSS Project 1, 2,\nand 3 bonds ( both low-coupon and high-coupon) with a face value of\n$205 million.\nWith WPPSS, explains Buffett, Berkshire acquired a $139 million\nbusiness that could expect to earn $22.7 million annually after tax (the\ncumulative value of WPPSS annual coupons) and would pay those earnings to Berkshire in cash. Buffett points out there were few businesses\navailable for purchase during this time that were selling at a discount to\nbook value and earning 16.3 percent after tax on unleveraged capital.\nBuffett figured that if he set out to purchase an unleveraged operating\ncompany earning $22.7 million after tax ($45 million pretax), it would\nhave cost Berkshire between $250 and $300 million—assuming he could\nfind one. Given a strong business that he understands and likes, Buffett\nwould have happily paid that amount. But, he points out, Berkshire paid\nhalf that price for WPPSS bonds to realize the same amount of earnings.\nFurthermore, Berkshire purchased the business (the bonds) at a 32 percent discount to book value.\nLooking back, Buffett admits that the purchase of WPPSS bonds\nturned out better than he expected. Indeed, the bonds outperformed\nmost business acquisitions made in 1983. Buffett has since sold the\nWPPSS low-coupon bonds. These bonds, which he purchased at a\nsignificant discount to par value, doubled in price while annually paying Berkshire a return of 15 to 17 percent tax-free. “Our WPPSS experience, though pleasant, does nothing to alter our negative opinion\nabout long-term bonds,” said Buffett. “It only makes us hope that we\nrun into some other large stigmatized issue, whose troubles have caused\nit to be significantly misappraised by the market.”2\nRJR Nabisco\nLater in the 1980s, a new investment vehicle was introduced to the financial markets. The formal name is high-yield bond, but most investors, then and now, call them junk bonds.\nIn Buffett’s view, these new high-yield bonds were different from\ntheir predecessor “fallen angels”—Buffett’s term for investment-grade\nbonds that, having fallen on bad times, were downgraded by ratings\nagencies. The WPPSS bonds were fallen angels. He described the new\nhigh-yield bonds as a bastardized form of the fallen angels and, he said,\nwere junk before they were issued.\nWall Street’s securities salespeople were able to promote the legitimacy of junk bond investing by quoting earlier research that indicated\nhigher interest rates compensated investors for the risk of default. Buffett argued that earlier default statistics were meaningless since they\nwere based on a group of bonds that differed significantly from the junk\nbonds currently being issued. It was illogical, he said, to assume that\njunk bonds were identical to the fallen angels. “That was an error similar to checking the historical death rate from Kool-Aid before drinking the version served at Jonestown.”3\nAs the 1980s unfolded, high-yield bonds became junkier as new offerings f looded the market. “Mountains of junk bonds,” noted Buffett,\n“were sold by those who didn’t care to those that didn’t think and there\nwas no shortage of either.”4 At the height of this debt mania, Buffett\npredicted that certain capital enterprises were guaranteed to fail when it\nbecame apparent that debt-laden companies were struggling to meet\ntheir interest payments. In 1989, Southmark Corporation and Integrated Resources both defaulted on their bonds. Even Campeau Corporation, a U.S. retailing empire created with junk bonds, announced it\nwas having difficulty meeting its debt obligations. Then on October 13,\n1989, UAL Corporation, the target of a $6.8 billion management-union\nled buyout that was to be financed with high-yield bonds, announced\nthat it was unable to obtain financing. Arbitrageurs sold their UAL common stock position, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 190\npoints in one day.\nThe disappointment over the UAL deal, coupled with the losses in\nSouthmark and Integrated Resources, led many investors to question\nthe value of high-yield bonds. Portfolio managers began dumping\ntheir junk bond positions. Without any buyers, the price for highyield bonds plummeted. After beginning the year with outstanding\ngains, Merrill Lynch’s index of high-yield bonds returned a paltry 4.2\npercent compared with the 14.2 percent returns of investment-grade\nbonds. By the end of 1989, junk bonds were deeply out of favor with\nthe market.\nA year earlier, Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts had succeeded in purchasing RJR Nabisco for $25 billion financed principally with bank\ndebt and junk bonds. Although RJR Nabisco was meeting its financial\nobligations, when the junk bond market unraveled, RJR bonds declined along with other junk bonds. In 1989 and 1990, during the junk\nbond bear market, Buffett began purchasing RJR bonds.\nMost junk bonds continued to look unattractive during this time, but\nBuffett figured RJR Nabisco was unjustly punished. The company’s stable products were generating enough cash f low to cover its debt payments. Additionally, RJR Nabisco had been successful in selling portions\nof its business at very attractive prices, thereby reducing its debt-toequity ratio. Buffett analyzed the risks of investing in RJR and concluded\nthat the company’s credit was higher than perceived by other investors\nwho were selling their bonds. RJR bonds were yielding 14.4 percent (a\nbusinesslike return), and the depressed price offered the potential for capital gains.\nSo, between 1989 and 1990, Buffett acquired $440 million in discounted RJR bonds. In the spring of 1991, RJR Nabisco announced it\nwas retiring most of its junk bonds by redeeming them at face value. The\nRJR bonds rose 34 percent, producing a $150 million capital gain for\nBerkshire Hathaway.\nLevel 3 Communications\nIn 2002, Buffett bought up large bundles of other high-yield corporate\nbonds, increasing his holdings in these securities sixfold to $8.3 billion.\nOf the total, 65 percent were in the energy industry and about $7 billion were bought through Berkshire insurance companies.\nDescribing his thinking in the 2002 letter to shareholders, Buffett\nwrote, “The Berkshire management does not believe the credit risks associated with the issuers of these instruments has correspondingly declined.” And this comes from a man who does not take unaccounted-for\n(read: unpriced) risks. To that point, he added, “Charlie and I detest taking even small risks unless we feel we are being adequately compensated\nfor doing so. About as far as we will go down that path is to occasionally\neat cottage cheese a day after the expiration date on the carton.”5\nIn addition to pricing his risk, he also typically bought the securities at far less than what they were worth, even at distressed prices, and\nwaited until the asset value was realized.\nWhat is particularly intriguing about these bond purchases is that, in\nall likelihood, Buffett would not have bought equity in many of these\ncompanies. By the end of 2003, however, his high-yield investments paid\noff to the tune of about $1.3 billion, while net income for the company\nthat year was a total of $8.3 billion. As the high-yield market skyrocketed, some of the bonds were called or sold. Buffett’s comment at the\ntime was simply, “Yesterday’s weeds are being priced as today’s f lowers.”\nIn July 2002, three companies invested a total of $500 million in\nBroomfield, Colorado-based Level 3 Communications’ ten-year convertible bonds, with a coupon of 9 percent and a conversion price of\n$3.41, to help the company make acquisitions and to enhance the company’s capital position. The three were Berkshire Hathaway ($100 million), Legg Mason ($100 million) and Longleaf Partners ($300 million).\nTechnology-intensive companies are not Buffett’s normal acquisition\nfare; he candidly admits he does not know of a way to properly value\ntechnology companies. This was an expensive deal for Level 3 but it gave\nthem the cash and credibility when they needed it. For his part, Buffett\nobtained a lucrative (9 percent) investment with an equity position. At\nthe time, Buffett was quoted as saying that investors should expect 7 to 8\npercent returns from the stock market annually, so at 9 percent, he was\nahead of the game.\nThere is another aspect to this story that is typical of Buffett—a\nstrong component of managerial integrity and personal relationships.\nLevel 3 Communications was a spin-off from an Omaha-based construction company, Peter Kiewit Sons; Buffett’s friend Walter Scott Jr.,\nis both chairman emeritus of Kiewit and chairman of Level 3. Often\ncalled Omaha’s first citizen, Scott was the driving force behind the\ncity’s zoo, its art museum, the engineering institute, and the Nebraska\nGame and Parks Foundation. Scott and Buffett have close personal and\nprofessional connections: Scott sits on Berkshire’s board, and the two\nmen are only f loors away from each other at Kiewit Plaza.\nEven though Buffett knew Scott well and held him in high regard,\nhe wanted the investment to be fair and transparent, with no question\nthat the relationship between the two men unduly inf luenced the deal.\nSo Buffett suggested that O. Mason Hawkins, chairman and chief executive of Southeastern Asset Management, which advises Longleaf\nPartners, set up the deal and negotiate the terms.\nBy mid-June 2003, a year later, Buffett, Legg Mason, and Longleaf\nPartners exchanged $500 million for a total of 174 million Level 3 common shares (including an extra 27 million shares as an incentive to convert). (Longleaf had already converted $43 million earlier in the year\nand then converted the rest, $457 million, in June.)\nBuffett received 36.7 million shares. In June, he sold 16.8 million for\n$117.6 million, and in November sold an additional 18.3 million shares\nfor $92.4 million. Sure enough, Level 3 made good on its debt payments,\nand by the end of 2003, Buffett had doubled his money in 16 months.\nOn top of that, his bonds had earned $45 million of interest, and he still\nheld on to 1,644,900 of Level 3’s shares.\nQwest\nIn the summer of 2002, Berkshire purchased hundreds of millions of dollars of bonds issued by Qwest Communications, a struggling telecommunications company based in Denver formerly known as US West, and its\nregulatory operating subsidiary, Qwest Corporation. At the time, Qwest\nhad $26 billion in debt and was in the midst of restating its 1999, 2000,\nand 2001 financial statements. Bankruptcy rumors were f lying. Qwest\ncorporate bonds were trading at thirty-five to forty cents on the dollar\nand the bonds of its operating company at eighty cents to the dollar.\nSome of the bonds were yielding 12.5 percent and were backed with specific assets; other, riskier bonds were not. Buffett bought both.\nMost analysts at the time said that Qwest’s assets had enough value\nfor Buffett to more than recover his investment given the current trading price. And, if it had not been for the interest payments, Qwest\nwould have had a healthy cash f low. The company’s most valuable asset\nwas the 14-state local phone service franchise, but Buffett had faith that\nwith former Ameritech CEO, Dick Notebaert, at the helm, the company would solve its problems.\nAmazon.com\nIn July 2002, only one week after Buffett wrote CEO Jeff Bezos a letter praising him for his decision to account for stock options as an expense, Buffett bought $98.3 million of Amazon’s high-yield bonds.\nBuffett clearly appreciates managers who exhibit integrity and\nstrong values, and he has long advocated for expensing stock options,\nbut he certainly was not on a goodwill mission when he bought the\nAmazon.com bonds. The Government Employees Insurance Company,\nthe auto insurance unit of Berkshire, stood to make $16.4 million profit\non the investment in high-yield bonds, a 17 percent return in nine\nmonths if Amazon repurchased the $264 million in 10 percent senior\nnotes that were issued in 1998. Later that summer, Buffett bought an\nadditional $60.1 million of Amazon’s 67⁄8 percent convertible bonds.\nAssuming a price of $60.00 per $1,000 bond, the yield would have been\na healthy 11.46 percent and the yield to maturity would have been even\nhigher once interest payments were calculated in.\nIt is well known that Buffett sticks with things he understands and\nshies away from technology. His involvement with the Internet is limited\nto three online activities: He buys books, reads the Wall Street Journal,\nand plays bridge. Buffett even made fun of his own technology avoidance\nin his 2000 letter to shareholders: “We have embraced the 21st century\nby entering such cutting-edge industries as brick, carpet and paint. Try\nto control your excitement.”6\nSo why was he attracted to Amazon’s bonds? First, he said, they\nwere “extraordinarily cheap.” Second, he had faith that the company\nwould thrive. Buffett may also have observed that Amazon.com had a\nsimilar profile to many of his other investments in retail companies.\nAmazon.com generates its revenue through huge amounts of sales for\nlow prices and although it has low margins, the company is efficient\nand profitable. Buffett admires the way Bezos has created a megabrand and the way he has pulled the company through some very difficult times.\nARBITRAGE\nArbitrage, in its simplest form, involves purchasing a security in one\nmarket and simultaneously selling the same security in another market.\nThe object is to profit from price discrepancies. For example, if stock in\na company was quoted as $20 per share in the London market and $20.01\nin the Tokyo market, an arbitrageur could profit from simultaneously\npurchasing shares of the company in London and selling the same shares\nin Tokyo. In this case, there is no capital risk. The arbitrageur is merely\nprofiting from the inefficiencies that occur between markets. Because\nthis transaction involves no risk, it is appropriately called riskless arbitrage. Risk arbitrage, on the other hand, is the sale or purchase of a security in hopes of profiting from some announced value.\nThe most common type of risk arbitrage involves the purchase of a\nstock at a discount to some future value. This future value is usually\nbased on a corporate merger, liquidation, tender offer, or reorganization.\nThe risk an arbitrageur confronts is that the future announced price of\nthe stock may not be realized.\nTo evaluate risk arbitrage opportunities, explains Buffett, you must\nanswer four basic questions. “How likely is it that the promised event\nwill indeed occur? How long will your money be tied up? What chance\nis there that something better will transpire—a competing takeover\nbid, for example? What will happen if the event does not take place because of antitrust action, financing glitches, etc.?”7\nConfronted with more cash than investable ideas, Buffett has often\nturned to arbitrage as a useful way to employ his extra cash. The Arkata\nCorporation transaction in 1981, where he bought over 600,000 shares\nas the company was going through a leveraged buyout, was a good example. However, whereas most arbitrageurs might participate in fifty or\nmore deals annually, Buffett sought out only a few, financially large\ntransactions. He limited his participation to deals that were announced\nand friendly, and he refused to speculate about potential takeovers or the\nprospects for greenmail.\nAlthough he never calculated his arbitrage performance over the\nyears, Buffett estimated that Berkshire has averaged an annual return of\nabout 25 percent pretax. Because arbitrage is often a substitute for\nshort-term Treasury bills, Buffett’s appetite for deals f luctuated with\nBerkshire’s cash level.\nNowadays, however, he does not engage in arbitrage on a large\nscale but rather keeps his excess cash in Treasuries and other short-term\nliquid investments. Sometimes Buffett holds medium-term, tax-exempt\nbonds as cash alternatives. He realizes that by substituting mediumterm bonds for short-term Treasury bills, he runs the risk of principal\nloss if he is forced to sell at disadvantageous time. But because these taxfree bonds offer higher aftertax returns than Treasury bills, Buffett figures that the potential loss is offset by the gain in income.\nWith Berkshire’s historical success in arbitrage, shareholders might\nwonder why Buffett strayed from this strategy. Admittedly, Buffett’s investment returns were better than he imagined, but by 1989 the arbitrage landscape started changing. The financial excesses brought about by\nthe leveraged buyout market were creating an environment of unbridled\nenthusiasm. Buffett was not sure when lenders and buyers would come to\ntheir senses, but he has always acted cautiously when others are giddy.\nEven before the collapse of the UAL buyout in October 1989, Buffett\nwas pulling back from arbitrage transactions. Another reason may be that\ndeals of a size that would really make a difference to Buffett’s very large\nportfolio simply do not exist.\nIn any case, Berkshire’s withdrawal from arbitrage was made easier\nwith the advent of convertible preferred stocks.\nCONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCKS\nA convertible preferred stock is a hybrid security that possesses characteristics of both stocks and bonds. Generally, these stocks provide investors with higher current income than common stocks. This higher\nyield offers protection from downside price risk. If the common stock\ndeclines, the higher yield of the convertible preferred stock prevents it\nfrom falling as low as the common shares. In theory, the convertible\nstock will fall in price until its current yield approximates the value of a\nnonconvertible bond with a similar yield, credit, and maturity.\nA convertible preferred stock also provides the investor with the opportunity to participate in the upside potential of the common shares.\nSince it is convertible into common shares, when the common rises, the\nconvertible stock will rise as well. However, because the convertible\nstock provides high income and has the potential for capital gains, it is\npriced at a premium to the common stock. This premium is ref lected in\nthe rate at which the preferred is convertible into common shares. Typically, the conversion premium may be 20 percent to 30 percent. This\nmeans that the common must rise in price 20 to 30 percent before\nthe convertible stock can be converted into common shares without losing value.\nIn the same way that he invested in high-yield bonds, Buffett invested in convertible preferred stocks whenever the opportunity presented itself as better than other investments. In the late 1980s and\n1990s, Buffett made several investments in convertible preferred stocks,\nincluding Salomon Brothers, Gillette, USAir, Champion International,\nand American Express.\nTakeover groups were challenging several of these companies, and\nBuffett became known as a “white knight,” rescuing companies from\nhostile invaders. Buffett, however, certainly did not perceive himself as a\npro bono savior. He simply saw these purchases as good investments\nwith a high potential for profit. At the time, the preferred stocks of these\ncompanies offered him a higher return than he could find elsewhere.\nSome of the companies issuing the convertible preferred securities\nwere familiar to Buffett, but in other cases he had no special insight about\nthe business nor could he predict with any confidence what its future cash\nf lows would be. This unpredictability, Buffett explains, is the precise reason Berkshire’s investment was a convertible preferred issue rather than\ncommon stock. Despite the conversion potential, the real value of the preferred stock, in his eye, was its fixed-income characteristics.\nThere is one exception: MidAmerican. This is a multifaceted transaction involving convertible preferred and common stock as well as debt.\nHere, Buffett values the convertible preferred for its fixed-income return as well as for its future equity stake.\nMidAmerican\nOn March 14, 2000, Berkshire acquired 34.56 million shares of convertible preferred stock along with 900,942 shares of common stock in\nMidAmerican Energy Holdings Company, a Des Moines-based gas and\nelectric utility, for approximately $1.24 billion, or $35.05 per share.\nTwo years later, in March 2002, Berkshire bought 6.7 million more\nshares of the convertible preferred stock for $402 million. This brought\nBerkshire’s holdings to over 9 percent voting interest and just over 80\npercent economic interest in MidAmerican.\nSince 2002, Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries also have acquired approximately $1.728 million of 11 percent nontransferable\ntrust preferred securities, of which $150 million were redeemed in\nAugust 2003. An additional $300 million was invested by David Sokol,\nMidAmerican’s chairman and CEO, and Walter Scott, MidAmerican’s\nlargest individual shareholder. It was, in fact, Scott who initially approached Buffett ; it was the first major deal they had worked on together in their 50 years of friendship.\nThe price Buffett paid for MidAmerican was toward the low end of\nthe scale, which according to reports was $34 to $48 per share, so he\nwas able to achieve a certain discount. Yet Buffett also committed himself and Berkshire to MidAmerican’s future growth to the extent that\nthey would support MidAmerican’s acquisition of pipelines up to $15\nbillion. As part of its growth strategy, MidAmerican, with Buffett’s\nhelp, bought pipelines from distressed energy merchants.\nOne such purchase happened almost immediately. In March 2002,\nBuffett bought, from Tulsa-based Williams Company, the Kern River\nGas Transmission project, which transported 850 million cubic feet of\ngas per day over 935 miles. Buffett paid $960 million, including assumption of debt and an additional $1 billion in capital expenses.\nMidAmerican also went on to acquire Dynegy’s Northern Natural\ngas pipeline later in 2002 for a bargain price of about $900 million, plus\nthe assumption of debt. Then, as of early January 2004, Berkshire announced it would put up about 30 percent of the costs, or $2 billion, for\na new natural gas pipeline tapping Alaskan North Slope natural gas reserves that would boost U.S. reserves by 7 percent. MidAmerican chairman Sokol said that without Buffett’s help, the investment would have\nbeen a strain on MidAmerican.\nIn another but related transaction, a Berkshire subsidiary, MEHC\nInvestment Inc., bought $275 million of Williams’s preferred stock.\nThis preferred stock does not generally vote with the common stock in\nthe election of directors, but in this deal Berkshire Hathaway gained the\nright to elect 20 percent of MidAmerican’s board as well as rights of approval over certain important transactions.\nLater that summer, Buffett, along with Lehman Brothers, provided\nWilliams with a one-year $900 million senior loan at over 19 percent,\nsecured by almost all the oil and gas assets of Barrett Resources, which\nWilliams originally acquired for about $2.8 billion. It was reported that\nBuffett’s loan was part of a $3.4 billion package of cash and credit that\nWilliams, still an investment-grade company, needed to stave off bankruptcy. The terms of the deal were tough and laden with conditions and\nfees that reportedly could have put the interest rate on the deal at 34\npercent. Still, it can be argued that not only was Buffett helping an\ninvestment-grade company out of a tight spot but also protecting himself against the high risk of the situation.\nAlthough MidAmerican was not Buffett’s only foray into the thenbeleaguered energy industry, it definitely was a complex, multifaceted\ninvestment. Buffett believed that the company was worth more than its\nthen-current value in the market. He knew that the management, including Walter Scott and David Sokol, operated with great credibility,\nintegrity, and intelligence. Finally, the energy industry can be a stable\nbusiness, and Buffett was hoping it would become even more stable and\nprofitable.\nIn MidAmerican, Buffett bought a fixed-income investment with\nan equity potential. As with all his other investments, he took a characteristic ownership approach and committed himself to the company’s\ngrowth. He made some money off the Williams fixed-income instruments while protecting himself with covenants, high rates, and assets\n(Barrett Resources). As it turned out, by October 2003, MidAmerican\nhad grown into the third largest distributor of electricity in the United\nKingdom and was providing electricity to 689,000 people in Iowa,\nwhile the Kern River and Northern Natural pipelines carried about 7.8\npercent of the natural gas in the United States. In total, the company had\nabout $19 billion of assets and $6 billion in annual revenues from 25\nstates and several other countries, and was yielding Berkshire Hathaway\nabout $300 million per year.\nIt is important to remember that Buffett thinks of convertible preferred\nstocks first as fixed-income securities and second as vehicles for appreciation. Hence the value of Berkshire’s preferred stocks cannot be any\nless than the value of a similar nonconvertible preferred and, because of\nconversion rights, is probably more.\nBuffett is widely regarded as the world’s greatest value investor,\nwhich basically means buying stocks, bonds, and other securities, and\nwhole companies, for a great deal less than their real worth, and waiting\nuntil the asset value is realized. So whether it is blue-chip stocks or highyield corporate debt, Buffett applies his same principles. A value investor\ngoes where the deals are.\nAlthough Buffett is usually thought of as a long-term investor in\ncommon stocks, he has the capability, stamina, and capital to wade into\nbeleaguered industries and pick out diamonds in the rough. He chooses\nspecific companies with honest, smart managers and cash-generating\nproducts. He also chooses the instruments that make the most sense at\nthe time. Usually, he has been right and when he’s not, he admits it. As\nit turns out, his decision to move strongly into fixed-income instruments in 2002 and 2003 was definitely right. In 2002, Berkshire’s gross\nrealized gain from fixed-income investments was $1 billion. In 2003,\nthat number almost tripled, to $2.7 billion.",
    "Managing Your Portfolio": "Up to this point, we have studied Warren Buffett’s approach to\nmaking investment decisions, which is built on timeless principles\ncodified into twelve tenets. We watched over his shoulder as he\napplied those principles to buy stocks and bonds, and to acquire companies. And we took the time to understand the insights from others\nthat helped shape his philosophy about investing.\nBut as every investor knows, deciding which stocks to buy is only\nhalf the story. The other half is the ongoing process of managing the\nportfolio and learning how to cope with the emotional roller coaster\nthat inevitably accompanies such decisions.\nIt is no surprise that here, too, the leadership of Warren Buffett will\nshow us the way.\nHollywood has given us a visual cliché of what a money manager looks\nlike: talking into two phones at once, frantically taking notes while trying to keep an eye on computer screens that blink and blip at him from\nall directions, tearing at his hair whenever one of those computer blinks\nshows a minuscule drop in stock price.\nWarren Buffett is about as far from that kind of frenzy as anything\nimaginable. He moves with the calm that comes of great confidence. He\nhas no need to watch a dozen computer screens at once, for the minuteby-minute changes in the market are of no interest to him. Warren\nBuffett doesn’t think in minutes, days, or months, but years. He doesn’t\nneed to keep up with hundreds of companies, because his investments\nare focused in just a select few. This approach, which he calls “focus investing,” greatly simplifies the task of portfolio management.\n“We just focus on a few outstanding companies. We’re focus\ninvestors.”1\nWARREN BUFFETT, 1994\nThe current state of portfolio management, as practiced by everyone\nelse, appears to be locked into a tug-of-war between two competing\nstrategies—active portfolio management and index investing.\nActive portfolio managers are constantly at work buying and selling\na great number of common stocks. Their job is to try to keep their\nclients satisfied. That means consistently outperforming the market so\nthat on any given day should a client apply the obvious measuring\nstick—how is my portfolio doing compared with the market overall\nthe answer will be positive and the client will leave her money in the\nfund. To keep on top, active managers try to predict what will happen\nwith stocks in the coming six months and continually churn the portfolio, hoping to take advantage of their predictions.\nIndex investing, on the other hand, is a buy-and-hold passive approach. It involves assembling, and then holding, a broadly diversified\nportfolio of common stocks deliberately designed to mimic the behavior\nof a specific benchmark index, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500. The\nsimplest and by far the most common way to achieve this is through an\nindexed mutual fund.\nProponents of both approaches have long waged combat to prove\nwhich one will ultimately yield the higher investment return.\nActive portfolio managers argue that, by virtue of their superior\nstock-picking skills, they can do better than any index. Index strategists, for their part, have recent history on their side. In a study that\ntracked results in a twenty-year period, from 1977 through 1997, the\npercentage number of equity mutual funds that have been able to beat\nthe Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped dramatically, from 50 percent in the early years to barely 25 percent in the final four years. And\nas of November 1998, 90 percent of actively managed funds were underperforming the market (averaging 14 percent lower than the S&P\n500), which means that only 10 percent were doing better.2\nActive portfolio management as commonly practiced today stands a\nvery small chance of outperforming the index. For one thing, it is\ngrounded in a very shaky premise: Buy today whatever we predict can\nbe sold soon at a profit, regardless of what it is. The fatal f law in that\nlogic is that given the complexity of the financial universe, predictions\nare impossible. Second, this high level of activity comes with transaction costs that diminish the net returns to investors. When we factor in\nthese costs, it becomes apparent that the active money management\nbusiness has created its own downfall.\nIndexing, because it does not trigger equivalent expenses, is better\nthan actively managed portfolios in many respects. But even the best\nindex fund, operating at its peak, will only net you exactly the returns\nof the overall market. Index investors can do no worse than the market,\nand also no better.\nIntelligent investors must ask themselves: Am I satisfied with average? Can I do better?\nA NEW CHOICE\nGiven a choice between active and index approaches, Warren Buffett\nwould unhesitatingly pick indexing. This is especially true for investors\nwith a very low tolerance for risk, and for people who know very little\nabout the economics of a business but still want to participate in the\nlong-term benefits of investing in common stocks.\n“By periodically investing in an index fund,” he says in inimitable\nBuffett style, “the know-nothing investor can actually outperform most\ninvestment professionals.”3 Buffett, however, would be quick to point\nout that there is a third alternative—a very different kind of active portfolio strategy that significantly increases the odds of beating the index.\nThat alternative is focus investing.\nFOCUS INVESTING: THE BIG PICTURE\nReduced to its essence, focus investing means this: Choose a few stocks\nthat are likely to produce above-average returns over the long haul,\nconcentrate the bulk of your investments in those stocks, and have the\nfortitude to hold steady during any short-term market gyrations.\nThe following sections describe the separate elements in the process.\n“Find Outstanding Companies”\nOver the years, Warren Buffett has developed a way of determining\nwhich companies are worthy places to put his money; it rests on a notion of great common sense: If the company is doing well and is managed by smart people, eventually its stock price will ref lect its inherent\nvalue. Buffett thus devotes most of his attention not to tracking share\nprice but to analyzing the economics of the underlying business and assessing its management.\nThe Buffett tenets, described in earlier chapters, can be thought of as\na kind of tool belt. Each tenet is one analytical tool, and in the aggregate\nTHE FOCUS INVESTOR’S GOLDEN RULES\n1. Concentrate your investments in outstanding companies\nrun by strong management.\n2. Limit yourself to the number of companies you can truly\nunderstand. Ten to twenty is good, more than twenty is\nasking for trouble.\n3. Pick the very best of your good companies, and put the\nbulk of your investment there.\n4. Think long-term: five to ten years, minimum.\n5. Volatility happens. Carry on.\nthey provide a method for isolating the companies with the best chance\nfor high economic returns. Buffett uses his tool belt to find companies\nwith a long history of superior performance and a stable management,\nand that stability means they have a high probability of performing in\nthe future as they have in the past. And that is the heart of focus investing: concentrating your investments in companies with the highest\nprobability of above-average performance.\n“Less Is More”\nRemember Buffett’s advice to a know-nothing investor—to stay with\nindex funds? What is more interesting for our purposes is what he\nsaid next:\n“If you are a know-something investor, able to understand business economics and to find five to ten sensibly priced companies that\npossess important long-term competitive advantages, conventional\ndiversification ( broadly based active portfolios) makes no sense for\nyou.”4\nWhat’s wrong with conventional diversification? For one thing, it\ngreatly increases the chances that you will buy something you don’t\nknow enough about. Philip Fisher, who was known for his focus portfolios, although he didn’t use the term, profoundly inf luenced Buffett’s\nthinking in this area. Fisher always said he preferred owning a small\nnumber of outstanding companies that he understood well to a large\nnumber of average ones, many of which he understood poorly.\n“Know-something” investors, applying the Buffett tenets, would\ndo better to focus their attention on just a few companies. How many\nis a few? Even the high priests of modern finance have discovered that,\non average, just fifteen stocks gives you 85 percent diversification.5 For\nthe average investor, a legitimate case can be made for ten to twenty.\nFocus investing falls apart if it is applied to a large portfolio with dozens\nof stocks.\n“Put Big Bets on High-Probability Events”\nPhil Fisher’s inf luence on Buffett can also be seen in another way—his\nbelief that the only reasonable course when you encounter a strong opportunity is to make a large investment. Warren Buffett echoes that\nthinking: “With each investment you make, you should have the courage\nand the conviction to place at least ten percent of your net worth in that\nstock.”6\nYou can see why Buffett says the ideal portfolio should contain no\nmore than ten stocks, if each is to receive 10 percent. Yet focus investing is not a simple matter of finding ten good stocks and dividing your\ninvestment pool equally among them. Even though all the stocks in a\nfocus portfolio are high-probability events, some will inevitably be\nhigher than others, and they should be allocated a greater proportion of\nthe investment.\nBlackjack players understand this intuitively: When the odds are\nstrongly in your favor, put down a big bet.\nI can’t be involved in 50 or 75 things. That’s a Noah’s Ark\nway of investing—you end up with a zoo. I like to put meaningful amounts of money in a few things.7\nWARREN BUFFETT, 1987\nThink back for a moment to Buffett’s decision to buy American\nExpress for the limited partnership, described in Chapter 1. When\nthreat of scandal caused the company’s share price to drop by almost\nhalf, Buffett invested a whopping 40 percent of the partnership’s assets\nin this one company. He was convinced that, despite the controversy,\nthe company was solid and eventually the stock price would return to\nits proper level; in the meantime, he recognized a terrific opportunity.\nBut was it worth almost half of his total assets? It was a big bet that paid\noff handsomely: Two years later, he sold the much-appreciated shares\nfor a profit of $20 million.\n“Be Patient”\nFocus investing is the antithesis of a broadly diversified high-turnover\napproach. Although focus investing stands the best chance among all active strategies of outperforming an index return over time, it requires\ninvestors to patiently hold their portfolio even when it appears that\nother strategies are winning.\nHow long is long enough? As you might imagine, there is no hardand-fast rule (although Buffett would probably say that anything less\nthan five years is a fool’s theory). The goal is not zero turnover (never\nselling anything); that’s foolish in the opposite direction, for it would\nprevent you from taking advantage of something better when it comes\nalong. As a general rule of thumb, we should aim for a turnover rate between 20 and 10 percent, which means holding the stock for somewhere between five and ten years.\n“Don’t Panic over Price Changes”\nFocus investing pursues above-average results, and there is strong evidence, both in academic research and actual case histories, that the pursuit is successful. There can be no doubt, however, that the ride is\nbumpy, for price volatility is a necessary by-product of the focus approach. Focus investors tolerate the bumpiness because they know that\nin the long run the underlying economics of the companies will more\nthan compensate for any short-term price f luctuations.\nBuffett is a master bump-ignorer. So is his partner, Charlie\nMunger, who once calculated, using a compound interest table and lessons learned playing poker, that as long as he could handle the price\nvolatility, owning as few as three stocks would be plenty. “I knew I\ncould handle the bumps psychologically, because I was raised by people\nwho believe in handling bumps.”8\nMaybe you also come from a long line of people who can handle\nbumps. But even if you were not born so lucky, you can acquire some of\ntheir traits. It is a matter of consciously deciding to change how you\nthink and behave. Acquiring new habits and thought patterns does not\nhappen overnight, but gradually teaching yourself not to panic and act\nrashly in response to the vagaries of the market is doable—and necessary.\nBUFFETT AND MODERN PORTFOLIO THEORY\nWarren Buffett’s faith in the fundamental ideas of focus investing puts\nhim at odds with many other financial gurus, and also with a package\nof concepts that is collectively known as modern portfolio theory. Because this is a book about Buffett’s thinking, and because Buffett himself does not subscribe to this theory, we will not spend much time\ndescribing it. But as you continue to learn about investing, you will\nhear about this theory, and so it is important to cover its basic elements.\nThen we’ll give Buffett a chance to weigh in on each.\nModern portfolio theory is a combination of three seminal ideas\nabout finance from three powerful minds. Harry Markowitz, a graduate\nstudent in economics at the University of Chicago, first quantified the\nrelationship between return and risk. Using a mathematical tool called\ncovariance, he measured the combined movement of a group of stocks,\nand used that to determine the riskiness of an entire portfolio.\nMarkowitz concluded that investment risk is not a function of how\nmuch the price of any individual stock changes, but how much a group\nof stocks changes in the same direction. If they do so, there is a good\nchance that economic shifts will drive them all down at the same time.\nThe only reasonable protection, he said, was diversification.\nAbout ten years later, another graduate student, Bill Sharpe from\nthe University of California-Los Angeles, developed a mathematical\nprocess for measuring volatility that simplified Markowitz’s approach.\nHe called it the Capital Asset Pricing Model.\nSo in the space of one decade, two academicians had defined two\nimportant elements of what we would later come to call modern portfolio theory: Markowitz with his idea that the proper reward/risk balance depends on diversification, and Sharpe with his definition of\nrisk. A third piece—the efficient market theory (EMT)—came from\na young assistant professor of finance at the University of Chicago,\nEugene Fama.\nFama began studying the changes in stock prices in the early 1960s.\nAn intense reader, he absorbed all the written work on stock market behavior then available and concluded that stock prices are not predictable\nbecause the market is too efficient. In an efficient market, as information becomes available, a great many smart people aggressively apply that\ninformation in a way that causes prices to adjust instantaneously, before\nanyone can profit. At any given moment, stock prices ref lect all available\ninformation. Predictions about the future therefore have no place in an\nefficient market, because the share prices adjust too quickly.\nBuffett’s View of Risk\nIn modern portfolio theory, the volatility of the share price defines risk.\nBut throughout his career, Buffett has always perceived a drop in share\nprices as an opportunity to make money. In his mind, then, a dip in price\nactually reduces risk. He points out, “For owners of a business—and\nthat’s the way we think of shareholders—the academics’ definition of\nrisk is far off the mark, so much so that it produces absurdities.”9\nBuffett has a different definition of risk: the possibility of harm.\nAnd that is a factor of the intrinsic value of the business, not the price\nbehavior of the stock. Financial harm comes from misjudging the future profits of the business, plus the uncontrollable, unpredictable effect\nof taxes and inf lation.\nFurthermore, Buffett sees risk as inextricably linked to an investor’s\ntime horizon. If you buy a stock today, he explains, with the intention\nof selling it tomorrow, then you have entered into a risky transaction.\nThe odds of predicting whether share prices will be up or down in a\nshort period are the same as the odds of predicting the toss of a coin;\nyou will lose half of the time. However, says Buffett, if you extend your\ntime horizon out to several years (always assuming that you have made\na sensible purchase), then the odds shift meaningfully in your favor.\nBuffett’s View of Diversification\nBuffett’s view on risk drives his diversification strategy, and here, too,\nhis thinking is the polar opposite of modern portfolio theory. According to that theory, the primary benefit of a broadly diversified portfolio is to mitigate the price volatility of the individual stocks. But if you\nare unconcerned with price volatility, as Buffett is, then you will also\nsee portfolio diversification in a different light.\nHe knows that many so-called pundits would say the Berkshire\nstrategy is riskier, but he is not swayed. “We believe that a policy of\nportfolio concentration may well decrease risk if it raises, as it should,\nboth the intensity with which an investor thinks about a business and\nthe comfort level he must feel with its economic characteristics before\nbuying into it.”10 By purposely focusing on just a few select companies,\nyou are better able to study them closely and understand their intrinsic\nvalue. The more knowledge you have about your company, the less risk\nyou are likely taking.\n“Diversification serves as protection against ignorance,” explains\nBuffett. “If you want to make sure that nothing bad happens to you relative to the market, you should own everything. There is nothing wrong\nwith that. It’s a perfectly sound approach for somebody who doesn’t\nknow how to analyze businesses.”11\nBuffett’s View of the Efficient Market Theory\nBuffett’s problem with the EMT rests on a central point: It makes no\nprovision for investors who analyze all the available information, as\nBuffett urges them to do, which gives them a competitive advantage.\nNonetheless, EMT is still religiously taught in business schools, a\nfact that gives Warren Buffett no end of satisfaction. “Naturally the\ndisservice done students and gullible investment professionals who\nhave swallowed EMT has been an extraordinary service to us and\nother followers of Graham,” Buffett wryly observed. “From a selfish\nstandpoint, we should probably endow chairs to ensure the perpetual\nteaching of EMT.”12\nIn many ways, modern portfolio theory protects investors who have\nlimited knowledge and understanding on how to value a business. But\nthat protection comes with a price. According to Buffett, “Modern\nportfolio theory tells you how to be average. But I think almost anybody can figure out how to do average in the fifth grade.”13\nTHE SUPERINVESTORS OF BUFFETTVILLE\nOne of the greatest investment books of all time came out in 1934, during the height of the Great Depression. Security Analysis, by Benjamin\nGraham and David Dodd, is universally acclaimed a classic, and is still\nin print after five editions and sixty-five years. It is impossible to overstate its inf luence on the modern world of investing.\nFifty years after its original publication, the Columbia Business\nSchool sponsored a seminar marking the anniversary of this seminal text.\nWarren Buffett, one of the school’s best-known alumni and the most famous modern-day proponent of Graham’s value approach, addressed the\ngathering. He titled his speech “The Superinvestors of Graham-andDoddsville,” and in its own way, it has become as much a classic as the\nbook it honored.14\nHe began by recapping the central argument of modern portfolio\ntheory—that the stock market is efficient, all stocks are priced correctly,\nand therefore anyone who beats the market year after year is simply\nlucky. Maybe so, he said, but I know some folks who have done it, and\ntheir success can’t be explained away as simply random chance.\nAnd he proceeded to lay out the evidence. The examples he presented that day were all people who had managed to beat the market\nconsistently over time, not because of luck, but because they followed\nprinciples learned from the same source: Ben Graham. They all reside,\nhe said, in the “intellectual village” of Graham-and-Doddsville.\nNearly two decades later, I thought it might be interesting to take\nan updated look at a few people who exemplify the approach defined\nby Graham and who also share Buffett’s belief in the value of a focused\nportfolio with a small number of stocks. I think of them as the Superinvestors of Buffettville: Charlie Munger, Bill Ruane, Lou Simpson,\nand of course Buffett. From their performance records, there is much\nwe can learn.\nCharlie Munger\nAlthough Berkshire Hathaway’s investment performance is usually tied\nto its chairman, we should never forget that vice chairman Charlie\nMunger is an outstanding investor. Shareholders who have attended\nBerkshire’s annual meeting or read Charlie’s thoughts in Outstanding\nInvestor Digest realize what a fine intellect he has.\n“I ran into him in about 1960,” said Buffett, “and I told him law was\nfine as a hobby but he could better.”15 As you may recall, Munger at the\ntime had a thriving law practice in Los Angeles, but gradually shifted his\nenergies to a new investment partnership bearing his name. The results\nof his talents can be found in Table 10.1.\n“His portfolio was concentrated in very few securities and therefore, his record was much more volatile,” Buffett explained, “but it\nwas based on the same discount-from-value approach.” In making investment decisions for his partnership, Charlie followed the Graham\nmethodology and would look only at companies that were selling\nbelow their intrinsic value. “He was willing to accept greater peaks\nand valleys in performance, and he happens to be a fellow whose psyche goes toward concentration.”16\nNotice that Buffett does not use the word risk in describing\nCharlie’s performance. Using the conventional definition of risk\n(price volatility), we would have to say that over its thirteen-year history Charlie’s partnership was extremely risky, with a standard deviation almost twice that of the market. But beating the average annual\nreturn of the market by 18 points over those same thirteen years was\nnot the act of a risky man, but of an astute investor.\nBill Ruane\nBuffett first met Bill Ruane in 1951, when both were taking Ben Graham’s Security Analysis class at Columbia. The two classmates stayed in\ncontact, and Buffett watched Ruane’s investment performance over the\nyears with admiration. When Buffett closed his investment partnership\nin 1969, he asked Ruane if he would be willing to handle the funds of\nsome of the partners, and that was the beginning of the Sequoia Fund.\nIt was a difficult time to set up a mutual fund. The stock market\nwas splitting into a two-tier market, with most of the hot money gyrating toward the so-called Nifty-Fifty (the big-name companies like IBM\nand Xerox), leaving the “value” stocks far behind. Ruane was undeterred. Later Buffett commented, “I am happy to say that my partners,\nto an amazing degree, not only stayed with him but added money, with\nhappy results.”17\nSequoia Fund was a true pioneer, the first mutual fund run on the\nprinciples of focus investing. The public record of Sequoia’s holdings\ndemonstrates clearly that Bill Ruane and Rick Cuniff, his partner in\nRuane, Cuniff & Company, managed a tightly focused, low-turnover\nportfolio. On average, well over 90 percent of the fund was concentrated\nbetween six and ten companies. Even so, the economic diversity of the\nportfolio was, and continues to be, broad.\nBill Ruane’s point of view is in many ways unique among money\nmanagers. Generally speaking, most managers begin with some preconceived notion about portfolio management and then fill in the portfolio\nwith various stocks. At Ruane, Cuniff & Company, the partners begin\nwith the idea of selecting the best possible stocks and then let the portfolio form around these selections.\nSelecting the best possible stocks, of course, requires a high level of\nresearch, and here again Ruane, Cuniff & Company stands apart from\nthe rest of the industry. The firm eschews Wall Street’s broker-fed research reports and instead relies on its own intensive company investigations. “We don’t go in much for titles at our firm,” Ruane once\nsaid, “[but] if we did, my business card would read Bill Ruane, Research Analyst.”18\nHow well has this unique approach served their shareholders?\nTable 10.2 outlines the investment performance of Sequoia Fund from\n1971 through 2003. During this period, Sequoia earned an average\nannual return of 18 percent, compared with the 12.9 percent of the\nStandard & Poor’s 500 Index.\nLou Simpson\nAbout the time Warren Buffett began acquiring the stock of the Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO) in the late 1970s, he\nalso made another acquisition that would have a direct benefit on the\ninsurance company’s financial health. His name was Lou Simpson.\nSimpson, who earned a master’s degree in economics from Princeton, worked for both Stein Roe & Farnham and Western Asset Management before Buffett lured him to GEICO in 1979. He is now CEO of\nCapital Operations for the company. Recalling his job interview, Buffett remembers that Lou had “the ideal temperament for investing.”19\nLou, he said, was an independent thinker who was confident of his own\nresearch and “who derived no particular pleasure from operating with\nor against the crowd.”\nSimpson, a voracious reader, ignores Wall Street research and instead pores over annual reports. His common stock selection process is\nsimilar to Buffett’s. He purchases only high-return businesses that are\nrun by able management and are available at reasonable prices. Lou also\nhas something else in common with Buffett. He focuses his portfolio on\nonly a few stocks. GEICO’s billion-dollar equity portfolio customarily\nowns fewer than ten stocks.\nBetween 1980 and 1996, GEICO’s portfolio achieved an average\nannual return of 24.7 percent, compared with the market’s return of\n17.8 percent (see Table 10.3). “These are not only terrific figures,” says\nBuffett, “but, fully as important, they have been achieved in the right\nway. Lou has consistently invested in undervalued common stocks that,\nindividually, were unlikely to present him with a permanent loss and\nthat, collectively, were close to risk free.”20\nIt is important to note that the focus strategy sometimes means enduring several weak years. Even the Superinvestors—undeniably skilled,\nundeniably successful—faced periods of short-term underperformance. A\nlook at Table 10.4 shows that they would have struggled through several\ndifficult periods.\nWhat do you think would have happened to Munger, Simpson, and\nRuane if they had been rookie managers starting their careers today in\nan environment that can only see the value of one year’s, or even one\nquarter’s, performance? They would probably have been canned, to\ntheir clients’ profound loss.\nMAKING CHANGES IN YOUR PORTFOLIO\nDon’t be lulled into thinking that just because a focus portfolio lags the\nstock market on a price basis from time to time, you are excused from\nthe ongoing responsibility of performance scrutiny. Granted, a focus investor should not become a slave to the stock market’s whims, but you\nshould always be acutely aware of all economic stirrings of the companies in your portfolio. There will be times when buying something,\nselling something else, is exactly the right thing to do.\nThe Decision to Buy: An Easy Guideline\nWhen Buffett considers adding an investment, he first looks at what he\nalready owns to see whether the new purchase is any better. “What\nBuffett is saying is something very useful to practically any investor,”\nCharlie Munger stresses. “For an ordinary individual, the best thing\nyou already have should be your measuring stick.”\nWhat happens next is one of the most critical but widely overlooked secrets to increasing the value of your portfolio. “If the new\nthing you are considering purchasing is not better than what you already know is available,” says Charlie, “then it hasn’t met your threshold. This screens out 99 percent of what you see.”21\nThe Decision to Sell: Two Good Reasons to Move Slowly\nFocus investing is necessarily a long-term approach to investing. If we\nwere to ask Buffett what he considers an ideal holding period, he would\nanswer “forever”—so long as the company continues to generate aboveaverage economics and management allocates the earnings of the company in a rational manner. “Inactivity strikes us as intelligent behavior,”\nhe explains.22\nIf you own a lousy company, you require turnover because otherwise you end up owning the economics of a subpar business for a long\ntime. But if you own a superior company, the last thing you want to do\nis to sell it.\nThis slothlike approach to portfolio management may appear quirky\nto those accustomed to actively buying and selling stocks on a regular\nbasis, but it has two important economic benefits, in addition to growing capital at an above-average rate:\n1. It works to reduce transaction costs. This is one of those commonsense dynamics that is so obvious it is easily overlooked.\nEvery time you buy or sell, you trigger brokerage costs that\nlower your net returns.\n2. It increases aftertax returns. When you sell a stock at a profit,\nyou will be hit with capital gain taxes, eating into your profit.\nThe solution: Leave it be. If you leave the gain in place (this is\nreferred to as unrealized gain), your money compounds more\nforcefully. Overall, investors have too often underestimated the\nenormous value of this unrealized gain—what Buffett calls an\n“interest-free loan from the Treasury.”\nTo make his point, Buffett asks us to imagine what happens if you\nbuy a $1 investment that doubles in price each year. If you sell the investment at the end of the first year, you would have a net gain of $.66\n(assuming you’re in the 34 percent tax bracket). Now you reinvest the\n$1.66, and it doubles in value by year-end. If the investment continues\nto double each year, and you continue to sell, pay the tax, and reinvest\nthe proceeds, at the end of twenty years you would have a net gain of\n$25,200 after paying taxes of $13,000. If, on the other hand, you purchased a $1 investment that doubled each year and never sold it until the\nend of twenty years, you would gain $692,000 after paying taxes of approximately $356,000.\nThe best strategy for achieving high aftertax returns is to keep your\naverage portfolio turnover ratio somewhere between 0 and 20 percent.\nTwo strategies lend themselves best to low turnover rates. One is to\nstick with an index mutual fund; they are low turnover by definition.\nThose who prefer a more active style of investing will turn to the second strategy: a focus portfolio.\nTHE CHALLENGE OF FOCUS INVESTING\nMy goal so far has been to lay out the argument for adopting the focus\ninvesting approach that Warren Buffett uses with such great success. I\nwould be doing you less than full service if I did not also make it plain\nthat an unavoidable consequence of this approach is heightened volatility. When your portfolio is focused on just a few companies, a price\nchange in any one of them is all the more noticeable and has greater\noverall impact.\nThe ability to withstand that volatility without undue secondguessing is crucial to your peace of mind, and ultimately to your\nfinancial success. Coming to terms with it is largely a matter of understanding the emotional side effects of investing, which is the topic\nof Chapter 11.\nMoney matters are about the most emotional issues of all, and that\nwill never change. But at the same time, you need not be constantly at\nthe mercy of those emotions, to the point that sensible action is handicapped. The key is to keep your emotions in appropriate perspective,\nand that is much easier if you understand something of the basic psychology involved.\nTHE CHALLENGE OF SUCCESS\nWarren Buffett’s challenge is not psychology; he understands the emotional side of investing as well as anyone and better than most. His challenge is maintaining the level of returns that others have come to expect\nfrom him. Two factors are involved: First, in very recent years, Buffett\nhasn’t found very many stocks that meet his price criteria. That’s a problem of the market. Second, when you’re driving a $100 billion company,\nit takes a significant level of economic return to move the needle. That’s\na problem of size.\nBuffett explains it this way: “Some years back, a good $10 million\nidea could do wonders for us. Today, the combination of ten such ideas\nand a triple in the value of each would increase the net worth of Berkshire by only one quarter of one percent. We need ‘elephants’ to make\nsignificant gains now—and they are hard to find.” 23 That was in early\n2002. Berkshire’s net worth has continued to grow since then, and, presumably, these elephants are even harder to find today.\nThe good news for most investors is that they can put their elephant\nguns away. The other good news is that, regardless of the size of their\npocketbook, the fundamentals of focus investing still apply. No matter\nhow much money you have to work with, you will want to do the\nsame thing Buffett does: When you find a high-probability event, put\ndown a big bet.",
    "The Psychology of Money": "The study of what makes us all tick is endlessly fascinating. It is especially intriguing to me that it plays such a strong role in investing, a world that people generally perceive to be dominated by cold\nnumbers and soulless data. When it comes to investment decisions, our\nbehavior is sometimes erratic, often contradictory, and occasionally\ngoofy. Sometimes our illogical decisions are consistently illogical, and\nsometimes no pattern is discernible. We make good decisions for inexplicable reasons, and bad decisions for no good reason at all.\nWhat is particularly alarming, and what all investors need to grasp,\nis that they are often unaware of their bad decisions. To fully understand the markets and investing, we have to understand our own irrationalities. That is every bit as valuable to an investor as being able to\nanalyze a balance sheet and income statement.\nIt is a complex, puzzling, intriguing study. Few aspects of human\nexistence are more emotion-laden than our relationship to money. And\nthe two emotions that drive decisions most profoundly are fear and\ngreed. Motivated by fear or greed, or both, investors frequently buy or\nsell stocks at foolish prices, far above or below a company’s intrinsic\nvalue. To say this another way, investor sentiment has a more pronounced impact on stock prices than a company’s fundamentals.\nMuch of what drives people’s decisions about stock purchases can\nbe explained only by principles of human behavior. And since the\nmarket is, by definition, the collective decisions made by all stock purchasers, it is not an exaggeration to say that psychological forces push\nand pull the entire market.\nAnyone who hopes to participate profitably in the market, therefore,\nmust allow for the impact of emotion. It is a two-sided issue: keeping\nyour own emotional profile under control as much as possible and being\nalert for those times when other investors’ emotion-driven decisions\npresent you with a golden opportunity.\nSuccess in investing doesn’t correlate with IQ once you’re\nabove the level of 125. Once you have ordinary intelligence,\nwhat you need is the temperament to control the urges that\nget other people into trouble in investing.1\nWARREN BUFFETT, 1999\nThe first step in properly weighting the impact of emotion in investing is understanding it. Fortunately, there is good information at\nhand. In recent years, psychologists have turned their attention to how\nestablished principles of human behavior play out when the dynamic is\nmoney. This blending of economics and psychology is known as behavioral finance, and it is just now moving down from the universities’\nivory towers to become part of the informed conversation among investment professionals—who, if they look over their shoulders, will find the\nshadow of a smiling Ben Graham.\nTHE TEMPERAMENT OF A TRUE INVESTOR\nBen Graham, as we know, fiercely urged his students to learn the basic\ndifference between an investor and a speculator. The speculator, he said,\ntries to anticipate and profit from price changes; the investor seeks only\nto acquire companies at reasonable prices. Then he explained further:\nThe successful investor is often the person who has achieved a certain\ntemperament—calm, patient, rational. Speculators have the opposite\ntemperament: anxious, impatient, irrational. Their worst enemy is not\nthe stock market, but themselves. They may well have superior abilities\nin mathematics, finance, and accounting, but if they cannot master\ntheir emotions, they are ill suited to profit from the investment process.\nGraham understood the emotional quicksand of the market as well\nas any modern psychologist, maybe better. His notion that true investors can be recognized by their temperament as well as by their skills\nholds as true today as when first expressed.\nInvestors have the following characteristics:\n• True investors are calm. They know that stock prices, inf luenced\nby all manner of forces both reasonable and unreasonable, will fall as\nwell as rise, and that includes stocks they own. When that happens, they\nreact with equanimity; they know that as long as the company retains\nthe qualities that attracted them as investors in the first place, the price\nwill come back up. In the meantime, they do not panic.\nOn this point, Buffett is blunt: Unless you can watch your stock\nholdings decline by 50 percent without becoming panic-stricken, you\nshould not be in the stock market. In fact, he adds, as long as you feel\ngood about the businesses you own, you should welcome lower prices as\na way to profitably increase your holdings.\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum, true investors also remain\ncalm in the face of what we might call the mob inf luence. When one\nstock or one industry or one mutual fund suddenly lands in the spotlight, the mob rushes in that direction. The trouble is, when everyone is\nmaking the same choices because “everyone” knows it’s the thing to\ndo, then no one is in a position to profit. In remarks reported in Fortune at the end of 1999, Buffett talked about the “can’t-miss-the-party\nfactor that has infected so many bull-market investors.2 His caution\nseems to be this: True investors don’t worry about missing the party;\nthey worry about coming to the party unprepared.\n• True investors are patient. Instead of being swept along in the enthusiasm of the crowd, true investors wait for the right opportunity.\nThey say no more often than yes. Buffett recalls that when he worked for\nGraham-Newman, analyzing stocks for possible purchase, Ben Graham\nturned down his recommendations most of the time. Graham, Buffett\nsays, was never willing to purchase a stock unless all the facts were in his\nfavor. From this experience, Buffett learned that the ability to say no is a\ntremendous advantage for an investor.\nWe don’t have to be smarter than the rest; we have to be more\ndisciplined than the rest.3\nWARREN BUFFETT, 2002\nBuffett believes that too many of today’s investors feel a need to purchase too many stocks, most of which are certain to be mediocre, instead\nof waiting for the few exceptional companies. To reinforce Graham’s lesson, Buffett often uses the analogy of a punch card. “An investor,” he\nsays, “should act as though he had a lifetime decision card with just\ntwenty punches on it. With every investment decision his card is\npunched, and he has one fewer available for the rest of his life.”4 If investors were restrained in this way, Buffett figures that they would be\nforced to wait patiently until a great investment opportunity surfaced.\n• True investors are rational. They approach the market, and the\nworld, from a base of clear thinking. They are neither unduly pessimistic\nnor irrationally optimistic; they are, instead, logical and rational.\nBuffett finds it odd that so many people habitually dislike markets\nthat are in their best interests and favor those markets that continually\nput them at a disadvantage. They feel optimistic when market prices are\nrising, pessimistic when prices are going down. If they go the next step\nand put those feelings into action, what do they do? Sell at lower prices\nand buy at higher prices—not the most profitable strategy.\nUndue optimism rears its head when investors blithely assume that\nsomehow the fates will smile on them and their stock choice will be the\none in a hundred that really takes off. It is especially prevalent in bull\nmarkets, when high expectations are commonplace. Optimists see no\nneed to do the fundamental research and analysis that would illuminate\nthe real long-term winners (e.g., finding the few keepers among all the\nlook-alike dot-coms) because the short-term numbers are so seductive.\nUndue pessimism, whether directed at one company or the market\nin general, motivates investors to sell at exactly the wrong time. In\nBuffett’s view, true investors are pleased when the rest of the world turns\npessimistic, because they see it for what it really is: a perfect time to buy\ngood companies at bargain prices. Pessimism, he says, is “the most common cause of low prices. . . . We want to do business in such an environment, not because we like pessimism but because we like the prices it\nproduces. It’s optimism that is the enemy of the rational buyer.”5\nWhether an investor feels optimistic or pessimistic is a statement of\nwhat that investor thinks about the future. Forecasting what is going to\nhappen next is tricky at best, and downright foolish when optimism (or\npessimism) is based more on emotion than on research. Buffett, who once\nremarked that “the only value of stock forecasters is to make fortune\ntellers look good,” makes no attempt to anticipate the periods in which\nthe market is likely to go up or down.6 Instead, he keeps an eye on the\ngeneral emotional tenor of the overall market, and acts accordingly. “We\nsimply attempt,” he explains, “to be fearful when others are greedy and to\nbe greedy only when others are fearful.”7\nINTRODUCING MR. MARKET\nTo show his students how powerfully emotions are tied to stock market f luctuations, and to help them recognize the folly of succumbing\nto emotion, Graham created an allegorical character he named “Mr.\nMarket.” Buffett has frequently shared the story of Mr. Market with\nBerkshire’s shareholders.\nImagine that you and Mr. Market are partners in a private business.\nEach day without fail, Mr. Market quotes a price at which he is willing\nto either buy your interest or sell you his. The business that you both\nown is fortunate to have stable economic characteristics, but Mr. Market’s quotes are anything but. For you see, Mr. Market is emotionally\nunstable. Some days, he is cheerful and enormously optimistic, and can\nonly see brighter days ahead. On these days, he offers a very high price\nfor shares in your business. At other times, Mr. Market is discouraged\nand terribly pessimistic; seeing nothing but trouble ahead, he quotes a\nvery low price for your shares in the business.\nMr. Market has another endearing characteristic, Graham said: He\ndoes not mind being snubbed. If Mr. Market’s quotes are ignored, he\nwill be back again tomorrow with a new quote. Graham warned his\nstudents that it is Mr. Market’s pocketbook, not his wisdom, that is useful. If Mr. Market shows up in a foolish mood, you are free to ignore\nhim or take advantage of him, but it will be disastrous if you fall under\nhis inf luence.\n“The investor who permits himself to be stampeded or unduly worried by unjustified market declines in his holdings is perversely transforming his basic advantage into a basic disadvantage,” Graham wrote.\n“That man would be better off if his stocks had no market quotation at\nall, for he would then be spared the mental anguish caused him by other\npersons’ mistakes of judgment.”8\nTo be successful, investors need good business judgment and the\nability to protect themselves from the emotional whirlwind that Mr.\nMarket unleashes. One is insufficient without the other. An important\nfactor in Buffett’s success is that he has always been able to disengage\nhimself from the emotional forces of the stock market. He credits Ben\nGraham and Mr. Market with teaching him how to remain insulated\nfrom the silliness of the market.\nIt was more than sixty years ago that Ben Graham introduced Mr.\nMarket, sixty years since he began writing about the irrationality that\nexists in the market. Yet in all the years since, there has been little apparent change in investor behavior. Investors still act irrationally. Foolish\nmistakes are still the order of the day. Fear and greed still permeate the\nmarketplace.\nWe can, through numerous academic studies and surveys, track investor foolishness. We can, if we follow Warren Buffett’s lead, turn\nother people’s fear or greed to our advantage. But to fully understand\nthe dynamics of emotion in investing, we turn to another individual:\nCharlie Munger.\nMunger’s understanding of how psychology affects investors, and\nhis insistence on taking it into account, have greatly inf luenced the\noperations of Berkshire Hathaway. It is one of his most profound contributions. In particular, he stresses what he calls the psychology of\nmisjudgment: What is it in human nature that draws people to mistakes of judgment?\nMunger believes a key problem is that our brain takes shortcuts in\nanalysis. We jump too quickly to conclusions. We are easily misled and\nare prone to manipulation. To compensate, Munger has developed a\nI came to the psychology of misjudgment almost against my\nwill; I rejected it until I realized my attitude was costing me a\nlot of money.9\nCHARLIE MUNGER, 1995\nmental habit that has served him well. “Personally, I’ve gotten so that I\nnow use a kind of two-track analysis,” he said in a 1994 speech reprinted\nin Outstanding Investor Digest. “First, what are the factors that really\ngovern the interests involved, rationally considered. And second, what\nare the subconscious inf luences where the brain at a subconscious level is\nautomatically doing these things—which by and large are useful, but\nwhich often misfunction.”10\nIn many ways, Charlie Munger is a genuine pioneer. He was thinking\nabout, and talking about, the psychological aspects of market behavior\nlong before other investment professionals gave it serious attention. But\nthat is beginning to change. Behavioral finance is now an accepted area\nof study in the economics department at major universities, including\nthe work done by Richard Thaler at the University of Chicago.\nObserving that people often make foolish mistakes and illogical assumptions when dealing with their own financial affairs, academics, including Thaler, began to dig deeper into psychological concepts to explain\nthe irrationalities in people’s thinking. It is a relatively new field of study,\nbut what we are learning is fascinating, as well as eminently useful to\nsmart investors.\nOverconfidence\nSeveral psychological studies have pointed out that errors in judgment\noccur because people in general are overconfident. Ask a large sample\nof people how many believe their skills at driving a car are above average, and an overwhelming majority will say they are excellent drivers. Another example: When asked, doctors believe they can diagnose\npneumonia with 90 percent confidence when in fact they are right only\n50 percent of the time.\nConfidence per se is not a bad thing. But overconfidence is another matter, and it can be particularly damaging when we are dealing\nwith our financial affairs. Overconfident investors not only make silly\ndecisions for themselves but also have a powerful effect on the market\nas a whole.\nOverconfidence explains why so many investors make wrong calls.\nThey have too much confidence in the information they gather and\nthink they are more right than they actually are. If all the players think\nthat their information is correct and they know something that others\ndo not, the result is a great deal of trading.\nOverreaction Bias\nThaler points to several studies that demonstrate people put too much\nemphasis on a few chance events, thinking they spot a trend. In particular, investors tend to fix on the most recent information they received\nand extrapolate from it; the last earnings report thus becomes in their\nmind a signal of future earnings. Then, believing that they see what\nothers do not, they make quick decisions from superficial reasoning.\nOverconfidence is at work here; people believe they understand the\ndata more clearly than others do and interpret it better. But there is more\nto it. Overreaction exacerbates overconfidence. The behaviorists have\nlearned that people tend to overreact to bad news and react slowly to good\nnews. Psychologists call this overreaction bias. Thus if the short-term\nearnings report is not good, the typical investor response is an abrupt, illconsidered overreaction, with its inevitable effect on stock prices.\nThaler describes this overemphasis on the short term as investor\n“myopia” (the medical term for nearsightedness) and believes most investors would be better off if they didn’t receive monthly statements. In\na study conducted with other behavioral economists, he proved his idea\nin dramatic fashion.\nThaler and colleagues asked a group of students to divide a hypothetical portfolio between stocks and Treasury bills. But first, they sat\nthe students in front of a computer and simulated the returns of the\nportfolio over a trailing twenty-five-year period. Half the students\nwere given mountains of information, representing the market’s\nvolatile nature with ever-changing prices. The other group was only\ngiven periodic performance measured in five-year time periods. Thaler\nthen asked each group to allocate their portfolio for the next forty years.\nThe group that had been bombarded by lots of information, some of\nwhich inevitably pointed to losses, allocated only 40 percent of its\nmoney to the stock market; the group that received only periodic information allocated almost 70 percent of its portfolio to stocks. Thaler,\nwho lectures each year at the Behavioral Conference sponsored by the\nNational Bureau of Economic Research and the John F. Kennedy School\nof Government at Harvard, told the group, “My advice to you is to invest in equities and then don’t open the mail.”11\nThis experiment, as well as others, neatly underscores Thaler’s notion of investor myopia—shortsightedness leading to foolish decisions.\nPart of the reason myopia provokes such an irrational response is another bit of psychology: our innate desire to avoid loss.\nLoss Aversion\nAccording to behaviorists, the pain of a loss is far greater than the enjoyment of a gain. Many experiments, by Thaler and others, have demonstrated that people need twice as much positive to overcome a negative.\nOn a 50/50 bet, with precisely even odds, most people will not risk anything unless the potential gain is twice as high as the potential loss.\nThis is known as asymmetrical loss aversion: The downside has\na greater impact than the upside, and it is a fundamental aspect of\nhuman psychology. Applied to the stock market, it means that investors\nfeel twice as bad about losing money as they feel good about picking\na winner.\nThis aversion to loss makes investors unduly conservative, at great\ncost. We all want to believe we made good decisions, so we hold onto\nbad choices far too long in the vague hope that things will turn around.\nBy not selling our losers, we never have to confront our failures. But if\nyou don’t sell a mistake, you are potentially giving up a gain that you\ncould earn by reinvesting smartly.\nMental Accounting\nA final aspect of behavioral finance that deserves our attention is what\npsychologists have come to call mental accounting. It refers to our habit\nof shifting our perspective on money as surrounding circumstances\nchange. We tend to mentally put money into different “accounts,” and\nthat determines how we think about using it.\nA simple situation will illustrate. Let us imagine that you have just\nreturned home from an evening out with your spouse. You reach for\nyour wallet to pay the babysitter, but discover that the $20 bill you\nthought was there, is not. So, when you drive the sitter home, you stop\nby an ATM and get another $20. Then the next day, you discover the\noriginal $20 bill in your jacket pocket.\nIf you’re like most people, you react with something like glee. The\n$20 in the jacket is “found” money. Even though the first $20 and the\nsecond $20 both came from your checking account, and both represent\nmoney you worked hard for, the $20 bill you hold in your hand is money\nyou didn’t expect to have, and you feel free to spend it frivolously.\nOnce again, Richard Thaler provides an interesting academic experiment to demonstrate this concept. In his study, he started with two\ngroups of people. People in the first group were given $30 in cash and\ntold they had two choices: (1) They could pocket the money and walk\naway, or (2) they could gamble on a coin f lip. If they won they would\nget $9 extra and if they lost they would have $9 deducted. Most (70\npercent) took the gamble because they figured at the very least they\nwould end up with $21 of found money. Those in the second group\nwere offered a different choice: (1) They could gamble on a coin toss—\nif they won, they would get $39 and if they lost they would get $21; or\n(2) they could get an even $30 with no coin toss. More than half (57\npercent) decided to take the sure money. Both groups of people stood\nto win the exact same amount of money with the exact same odds, but\nthey perceived the situation differently.12\nRisk Tolerance\nIn the same way that a strong magnet pulls together all the nearby\npieces of metal, your level of risk tolerance pulls together all the elements of the psychology of finance. The psychological concepts are abstract; where they get real is in the day-to-day decisions that you make\nabout buying and selling. And the common thread in all those decisions\nis how you feel about risk.\nIn the last dozen or so years, investment professionals have devoted\nconsiderable energy to helping people assess their risk tolerance. At first,\nit seemed like a simple task. By using interviews and questionnaires, they\ncould construct a risk profile for each investor. The trouble is, people’s\ntolerance for risk is founded in emotion, and that means it changes with\nchanging circumstances. When the market declines drastically, even\nthose with an aggressive profile will become very cautious. In a booming\nmarket, supposedly conservative investors add more stocks just as quickly\nas aggressive investors do.\nA true picture of risk tolerance requires digging below the surface\nof the standard assessment questions and investigating issues driven by\npsychology. A few years ago, in collaboration with Dr. Justin Green of\nVillanova University, I developed a risk analysis tool that focuses on\npersonality as much as on the more obvious and direct risk factors.\nSummarizing our research, we found that propensity for risk taking\nis connected to two demographic factors: gender and age. Women are\ntypically more cautious than men, and older people are less willing to\nassume risk than younger people. Looking at personality factors, we\nlearned that the investor with a high degree of risk tolerance will be\nsomeone who sets goals and believes he or she has control of the environment and can affect its outcome. This person sees the stock market\nas a contingency dilemma in which information combined with rational choices will produce winning results.\nFor investors, the implications of behavioral finance are clear: How\nwe decide to invest, and how we choose to manage those investments,\nhas a great deal to do with how we think about money. Mental accounting has been suggested as a further reason people don’t sell stocks\nthat are doing badly: In their minds, the loss doesn’t become real until\nthey act on it. Another powerful connection has to do with risk. We are\nfar more likely to take risks with found money. On a broader scale,\nmental accounting emphasizes one weakness of the efficient market hypothesis: It demonstrates that market values are determined not solely\nby the aggregated information but also by how human beings process\nthat information.\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF FOCUS INVESTING\nEverything we have learned about psychology and investing comes\ntogether in the person of Warren Buffett. He puts his faith in his\nown research, rather than in luck. His actions derive from carefully\nthought-out goals, and he is not swept off course by short-term events.\nHe understands the true elements of risk and accepts the consequences\nwith confidence.\nLong before behavioral finance had a name, it was understood and\naccepted by a few renegades like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger.\nCharlie points out that when he and Buffett left graduate school, they\n“entered the business world to find huge, predictable patterns of extreme irrationality.”13 He is not talking about predicting the timing,\nbut rather the idea that when irrationality does occur it leads to predictable patterns of subsequent behavior.\nWhen it comes to investing, emotions are very real, in the sense\nthat they affect people’s behavior and thus ultimately affect market\nprices. You have already sensed, I am sure, two reasons understanding\nthe human dynamic is so valuable in your own investing:\n1. You will have guidelines to help you avoid the most common\nmistakes.\n2. You will be able to recognize other people’s mistakes in time to\nprofit from them.\nAll of us are vulnerable to individual errors of judgment that can\naffect our personal success. When a thousand or a million people make\nerrors of judgment, the collective impact is to push the market in a\ndestructive direction. Then, so strong is the temptation to follow the\ncrowd, accumulated bad judgment only compounds itself. In a turbulent sea of irrational behavior, the few who act rationally may well be\nthe only survivors.\nSuccessful focus investors need a certain kind of temperament. The\nroad is always bumpy, and knowing the right path to take is often counterintuitive. The stock market’s constant gyrations can be unsettling to\ninvestors and make them act in irrational ways. You need to be on the\nlookout for these emotions and be prepared to act sensibly even when\nyour instincts may strongly call for the opposite behavior. But as we have\nlearned, the future rewards focus investing significantly enough to warrant our strong effort.",
    "The Unreasonable Man": "George Bernard Shaw wrote, “The reasonable man adapts himself\nto the world. The unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the\nworld to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.”1\nShall we conclude that Buffett is “the unreasonable man”? To do so,\nwe must presume that his investment approach represents progress in the\nfinancial world, an assumption I freely make. For when we look at the\nrecent achievements of the “reasonable” men, we see at best unevenness,\nat worst disaster.\nThe 1980s are likely to be remembered as the Future Shock decade\nof financial management. Program trading, leveraged buyouts, junk\nbonds, derivative securities, and index futures frightened many investors. The distinctions between money managers faded. The grind of\nfundamental research was replaced by the whirl of computers. Black\nboxes replaced management interviews and investigation. Automation\nreplaced intuition.\nThe late 1990s were, if anything, worse. That frenzied, overvalued\nmarketplace phenomenon generally known as the dot-com boom went\ndisastrously bust. Warren Buffett called it “The Great Bubble.” And we\nall know what happens to bubbles when they get too big—they burst,\ndripping sticky residue on everyone within range.\nMany investors have become disenchanted and estranged from the\nfinancial marketplace. The residue of the three-year bear market of\n2000 through 2002 left many with a particularly bitter taste in their\nmouths. Even now, with so many money managers unable to add value\nto client portfolios, it is easy to understand why passive investing has\ngained popularity.\nThroughout the past few decades, investors have f lirted with many\ndifferent investment approaches. Periodically, small capitalization, large\ncapitalization, growth, value, momentum, thematic, and sector rotation\nhave proven financially rewarding. At other times, these approaches have\nstranded their followers in periods of mediocrity. Buffett, the exception,\nhas not suffered periods of mediocrity. His investment performance,\nwidely documented, has been consistently superior. As investors and\nspeculators alike have been distracted by esoteric approaches to investing,\nBuffett has quietly amassed a multi-billion-dollar fortune. Throughout,\nbusinesses have been his tools, common sense his philosophy.\nHow did he do it?\nGiven the documented success of Buffett’s performance coupled\nwith the simplicity of his methodology, the more appropriate question\nis, why don’t other investors apply his approach? The answer may lie in\nhow people think about investing.\nWhen Buffett invests, he sees a business. Most investors see only a\nstock price. They spend far too much time and effort watching, predicting, and anticipating price changes and far too little time understanding\nthe business they are part owner of. Elementary as this may be, it is the\nroot that distinguishes Buffett.\nStocks are simple. All you do is buy shares in a great business\nfor less than the business is intrinsically worth, with management of the highest integrity and ability. Then you own those\nshares forever.2\nWARREN BUFFETT, 1990\nWhile other professional investors are busy studying capital asset\npricing models, beta, and modern portfolio theory, Buffett studies\nincome statements, capital reinvestment requirements, and the cashgenerating capabilities of his companies. His hands-on experience with\na wide variety of businesses in many industries separates Buffett from\nall other professional investors. “Can you really explain to a fish what\nit’s like to walk on land?” Buffett asks. “One day on land is worth a\nthousand years of talking about it and one day running a business has\nexactly the same kind of value.”3\nAccording to Buffett, the investor and the businessperson should\nlook at the company in the same way, because they both want essentially\nthe same thing. The businessperson wants to buy the entire company\nand the investor wants to buy portions of the company. Theoretically,\nthe businessperson and the investor, to earn a profit, should be looking at\nthe same variables.\nIf adapting Buffett’s investment strategy required only changing\nperspective, then probably more investors would become proponents.\nHowever, applying Buffett’s approach requires changing not only perspective but also how performance is evaluated and communicated. The\ntraditional yardstick for measuring performance is price change: the\ndifference between what you originally paid for a stock and its market\nprice today.\nIn the long run, the market price of a stock should approximate the\nchange in value of the business. However, in the short run, prices can\nswoop widely above and below a company’s value for any number of illogical reasons. The problem remains that most investors use these\nshort-term price changes to gauge the success or failure of their investment approach, even though the changes often have little to do with\nthe changing economic value of the business and much to do with anticipating the behavior of other investors.\nTo make matters worse, clients require professional money to report\nperformance in quarterly periods. Knowing that they must improve\nshort-term performance or risk losing clients, professional investors become obsessed with chasing stock prices.\nThe market is there only as a reference point to see if anybody\nis offering to do anything foolish.4\nWARREN BUFFETT, 1988\nBuffett believes it is foolish to use short-term prices to judge a company’s success. Instead, he lets his companies report their value to him\nby their economic progress. Once a year, he checks several variables:\n• Return on beginning shareholder’s equity\n• Change in operating margins, debt levels, and capital expenditure needs\n• The company’s cash-generating ability\nIf these economic measurements are improving, he knows the share\nprice, over the long term, should ref lect this. What happens to the stock\nprice in the short run is inconsequential.\nThe major goal of this book is to help investors understand and employ\nthe investment strategies that have made Buffett successful. It is my\nhope that, having learned from his past experiences, you will be able to\ngo forward and apply his methods. Perhaps in the future you may see\nexamples of “Buffett-like” purchases and will be in a position to profit\nfrom his teachings.\nFor instance . . .\n• When the stock market forces the price of a good business\ndownward, as it did to the Washington Post, or\n• When a specific risk temporarily punishes a business, as it did\nWells Fargo, or\n• When investor indifference allows a superior business such as\nCoca-Cola to be priced at half of its intrinsic value\ninvestors who know how to think and act like Buffett will be\nrewarded.\nThe Warren Buffett Way is deceptively simple. There are no computer programs to learn, no cumbersome investment banking manuals\nto decipher. There is nothing scientific about valuing a business and\nthen paying a price that is below this business value. “What we do is not\nbeyond anybody else’s competence,” says Buffett. “It is just not necessary to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary results.”5\nThe irony is that Buffett’s success lies partly in the failure of others.\n“It has been helpful to me,” he explains, “to have tens of thousands (students) turned out of business schools taught that it didn’t do any good to\nthink.”6 I do not mean to imply that Buffett is average, far from it. He\nis unquestionably brilliant. But the gap between Buffett and other professional investors is widened by their own willingness to play a loser’s\ngame that Buffett chooses not to play. Readers of this book have the\nsame choice.\nWhether you are financially able to purchase 10 percent of a company or merely one hundred shares, the Warren Buffett Way can help you\nachieve profitable investment returns. But this approach will help only\nthose investors who are willing to help themselves. To be successful, you\nmust be willing to do some thinking on your own. If you need constant\naffirmation, particularly from the stock market, that your investment decisions are correct, you will diminish your benefits. But if you can think\nfor yourself, apply relatively simple methods, and have the courage of\nyour convictions, you will greatly increase your chances for profit.\nWhenever people try something new, there is initial apprehension.\nAdopting a new and different investment strategy will naturally evoke\nsome uneasiness. In the Warren Buffett Way, the first step is the most\nchallenging. If you can master this first step, the rest of the way is easy.\nStep One: Turn off the Stock Market\nRemember that the stock market is manic-depressive. Sometimes it is\nwildly excited about future prospects, and at other times it is unreasonably depressed. Of course, this behavior creates opportunities, particularly when shares of outstanding businesses are available at irrationally\nlow prices. But just as you would not take direction from an advisor who\nexhibited manic-depressive tendencies, neither should you allow the\nmarket to dictate your actions.\nThe stock market is not a preceptor; it exists merely to assist you\nwith the mechanics of buying or selling shares of stock. If you believe\nthat the stock market is smarter than you are, give it your money by investing in index funds. But if you have done your homework and understand your business and are confident that you know more about\nyour business than the stock market does, turn off the market.\nBuffett does not have a stock quote machine in his office and he\nseems to get by just fine without it. If you plan on owning shares in an\noutstanding business for a number of years, what happens in the market\non a day-to-day basis is inconsequential. You do need to check in regularly, to see if something has happened that presents you with a nifty\nopportunity, but you will find that your portfolio weathers nicely even\nif you do not look constantly at the market.\n“After we buy a stock, we would not be disturbed if markets closed\nfor a year or two,” says Buffett. “We don’t need a daily quote on our\n100 percent position in See’s or H.H. Brown to validate our well being.\nWhy, then, should we need a quote on our 7 percent interest [today,\nmore than 8 percent] in Coke?”7\nBuffett is telling us that he does not need the market’s prices to validate Berkshire’s common stock investments. The same holds true for individual investors. You know you have approached Buffett’s level when\nyour attention turns to the stock market and the only question on your\nmind is: “Has anybody done anything foolish lately that will give me an\nopportunity to buy a good business at a great price?”\nStep Two: Don’t Worry about the Economy\nJust as people spend fruitless hours worrying about the stock market\nso, too, do they worry needlessly about the economy. If you find\nyourself discussing and debating whether the economy is poised for\ngrowth or tilting toward a recession, whether interest rates are moving up or down, or whether there is inf lation or disinf lation, STOP!\nGive yourself a break.\nOften investors begin with an economic assumption and then go\nabout selecting stocks that fit neatly within this grand design. Buffett\nconsiders this thinking to be foolish. First, no one has economic predictive powers any more than they have stock market predictive powers.\nSecond, if you select stocks that will benefit by a particular economic environment, you inevitably invite turnover and speculation, as you continuously adjust your portfolio to benefit in the next economic scenario.\nBuffett prefers to buy a business that has the opportunity to profit\nin any economy. Macroeconomic forces may affect returns on the margin, but overall, Buffett’s businesses are able to profit nicely despite vagaries in the economy. Time is more wisely spent locating and owning\na business that can profit in all economic environments than by renting\na group of stocks that do well only if a guess about the economy happens to be correct.\nStep Three: Buy a Business, Not a Stock\nLet’s pretend that you have to make a very important decision. Tomorrow you will have an opportunity to pick one business to invest in. To\nmake it interesting, let’s also pretend that once you have made your decision, you can’t change it and, furthermore, you have to hold the investment for ten years. Ultimately, the wealth generated from this business\nownership will support you in your retirement. Now, what are you going\nto think about?\nProbably many questions will run through your mind, bringing a\ngreat deal of confusion. But if Buffett were given the same test, he\nwould begin by methodically measuring the business against his basic\ntenets, one by one:\n• Is the business simple and understandable, with a consistent operating history and favorable long-term prospects?\n• Is it run by honest and competent managers, who allocate capital\nrationally, communicate candidly with shareholders, and resist the\ninstitutional imperative?\n• Are the company’s economics in good shape—with high\nprofit margins, owners’ earnings, and increased market value that\nmatches retained earnings?\n• Finally, is it available at a discount to its intrinsic value? Take note:\nOnly at this final step does Buffett look at the stock market price.\nCalculating the value of a business is not mathematically complex.\nHowever, problems arise when we wrongly estimate a company’s future cash f low. Buffett deals with this problem in two ways. First, he\nincreases his chances of correctly predicting future cash f lows by sticking with businesses that are simple and stable in character. Second, he\ninsists on a margin of safety between the company’s purchase price and\nits determined value. This margin of safety helps create a cushion that\nwill protect him—and you from companies whose future cash f lows\nare changing.\nStep Four: Manage a Portfolio of Businesses\nNow that you are a business owner as opposed to a renter of stocks, the\ncomposition of your portfolio will change. Because you are no longer\nmeasuring your success solely by price change or comparing annual price\nchange to a common stock benchmark, you have the liberty to select the\nbest businesses available. There is no law that says you must include every\nmajor industry within your portfolio, nor do you have to include 30, 40,\nor 50 stocks in your portfolio to achieve adequate diversification.\nBuffett believes that wide diversification is required only when investors do not understand what they are doing. If these “know-nothing”\ninvestors want to own common stocks, they should simply put their\nmoney in an index fund. But for the “know-something” investors, conventional diversification into dozens of stocks makes little sense. Buffett\nasks you to consider: If the best business you own presents the least financial risk and has the most favorable long-term prospects, why would\nyou put money into your twentieth favorite business instead of adding\nmoney to the top choice?\nNow that you are managing a portfolio of businesses, many things\nbegin to change. First, you are less likely to sell your best businesses just\nbecause they are returning a profit. Second, you will pick new businesses\nfor purchase with much greater care. You will resist the temptation to\npurchase a marginal company just because you have cash reserves. If the\ncompany does not pass your tenet screen, don’t purchase it. Be patient\nand wait for the right business. It is wrong to assume that if you’re not\nbuying and selling, you’re not making progress. In Buffett’s mind, it is\ntoo difficult to make hundreds of smart decisions in a lifetime. He would\nrather position his portfolio so he only has to make a few smart decisions.\nThe Essence of Warren Buffett\nThe driving force of Warren Buffett’s investment strategy is the rational\nallocation of capital. Determining how to allocate a company’s earnings\nis the most important decision a manager will make. Rationality—displaying rational thinking when making that choice—is the quality Buffett most admires. Despite underlying vagaries, a line of reason permeates\nthe financial markets. Buffett’s success is the result of locating that line of\nreason and never deviating from its path.\nBuffett has had his share of failures and no doubt will have a few\nmore in the years ahead. But investment success is not synonymous with\ninfallibility, but it comes about by doing more things right than wrong.\nThe Warren Buffett Way is no different. Its success depends as much on\neliminating those things you can get wrong, which are many and perplexing (predicting markets, economies, and stock prices), as on getting\nthings right, which are few and simple (valuing a business).\nWhen Buffett purchases stocks, he focuses on two simple variables:\nthe price of the business and its value. The price of a business can be\nfound by looking up its quote. Determining value requires some calculation, but it is not beyond the comprehension of those willing to do some\nhomework.\nInvesting is not that complicated. You need to know accounting, the language of business. You should read The Intelligent\nInvestor. You need the right mind-set, the right temperament.\nYou should be interested in the process and be in your circle of\ncompetence. Read Ben Graham and Phil Fisher, read annual\nreports and trade reports, but don’t do equations with Greek\nletters in them.8\nWARREN BUFFETT, 1993\nBecause you no longer worry about the stock market, the economy,\nor predicting stock prices, you are now free to spend more time understanding your businesses. You can spend more productive time reading\nannual reports and business and industry articles that will improve your\nknowledge as an owner. In fact, the more willing you are to investigate\nyour own business, the less dependent you will be on others who make\na living advising people to take irrational action.\nUltimately, the best investment ideas will come from doing your\nown homework. However, you should not feel intimidated. The Warren\nBuffett Way is not beyond the comprehension of most serious investors.\nYou do not have to become an MBA-level authority on business valuation to use it successfully. Still, if you are uncomfortable applying these\ntenets yourself, nothing prevents you from asking your financial advisor\nthese same questions. In fact, the more you enter into a dialogue on\nprice and value, the more you will begin to understand and appreciate\nthe Warren Buffett Way.\nBuffett, over his lifetime, has tried different investment gambits. At a\nyoung age he even tried his hand at stock charting. He has studied with\nthe brightest financial mind of the twentieth century, Benjamin Graham,\nand managed and owned a host of businesses with his partner, Charlie\nMunger. Over the past five decades, Buffett has experienced double-digit\ninterest rates, hyperinf lation, and stock market crashes. Through all the\ndistractions, he found his niche, that point where all things make sense:\nwhere investment strategy cohabits with personality. “Our (investment)\nattitude,” said Buffett, “fits our personalities and the way we want to live\nour lives.”6\nBuffett’s attitude easily ref lects this harmony. He is always upbeat\nand supportive. He is genuinely excited about coming to work every day.\n“I have in life all I want right here,” he says. “I love every day. I mean, I\ntap dance in here and work with nothing but people I like.”7 “There is\nno job in the world,” he says, “that is more fun than running Berkshire\nand I count myself lucky to be where I am.8",
    "Afterword: Managing Money the Warren Buffett Way": "I began my money management career at Legg Mason in the summer of\n1984. It was a typical hot and humid day in Baltimore. Fourteen newly\nminted investment brokers, including myself, walked into an openwindowed conference room to begin our training. Sitting down at our\ndesks, we all received a copy of The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin\nGraham (a book I had never heard of ) and a photocopy of the 1983\nBerkshire Hathaway annual report (a company I had never heard of )\nwritten by Warren Buffett (a man I had never heard of ).\nThe first day of class included introductions and welcomes from top\nmanagement, including some of the firm’s most successful brokers. One\nafter another, they proudly explained that Legg Mason’s investment\nphilosophy was 100 percent value-based. Clutching The Intelligent Investor, each took a turn at reciting chapter and verse from this holy\ntext. Buy stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios (P/E), low price-tobook value, and high dividends, they said. Don’t pay attention to the\nstock market’s daily gyrations, they said; its siren song would almost\ncertainly pull you in the wrong direction. Seek to become a contrarian,\nthey said. Buy stocks that are down in price and unpopular so you can\nlater sell them at higher prices when they again become popular.\n\nAFTERWORD\n\nThe message we received throughout the first day was both consistent and logical. We spent the afternoon analyzing Value Line research\nreports and learning to distinguish between stocks that were down in\nprice and appeared to be cheap and stocks that were up in price and appeared to be expensive. By the end of our first training session, we all believed we were in possession of the Holy Grail of investing. As we packed\nup our belongings, our instructor reminded us to take the Berkshire\nHathaway annual report with us and read it before tomorrow’s class.\n“Warren Buffett,” she cheerily reminded us, “was Benjamin Graham’s\nmost famous student, you know.”\nBack in my hotel room that night, I was wrung out with exhaustion. My eyes were blurry and tired, and my head was swimming with\nbalance sheets, income statements, and accounting ratios. Quite honestly, the last thing I wanted to do was to spend another hour or so reading an annual report. I was sure if one more investing factoid reached my\ninner skull, it would certainly explode. Reluctantly and very tiredly, I\npicked up the Berkshire Hathaway report.\nIt began with a salutation To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Here Buffett outlined the company’s major business principles: “Our long-term economic goal is to maximize the average annual\nrate of gain in intrinsic value on a per share basis,” he wrote. “Our preference would be to reach this goal by directly owning a diversified group\nof businesses that generate cash and consistently earn above-average returns on capital.” He promised, “We will be candid in our reporting to\nyou, emphasizing the pluses and minuses important in appraising business\nvalue. Our guideline is to tell you the business facts that we would want\nto know if our positions were reversed.”\nThe next fourteen pages outlined Berkshire’s major business holdings\nincluding Nebraska Furniture Mart, Buf falo Evening News, See’s Candy\nShops, and the Government Employees Insurance Company. And true to\nhis word, Buffett proceeded to tell me everything I would want to know\nabout the economics of these businesses, and more. He listed the common\nstocks held in Berkshire’s insurance portfolio, including Affiliated Publications, General Foods, Ogilvy & Mather, R.J. Reynolds Industries, and\nthe Washington Post. I was immediately struck by how seamlessly\nBuffett moved back and forth between describing the stocks in the portfolio and the business attributes of Berkshire’s major holdings. It was as if\nthe analyses of stocks and of businesses were one and the same.\nGranted, I had spent the entire day in class analyzing stocks, which\nI knew were partial ownership interests in businesses, but I had not\nmade this most important analytical connection. When I studied Value\nLine reports I saw accounting numbers and financial ratios. When I\nread the Berkshire Hathaway report I saw businesses, with products and\ncustomers. I saw economics and cash earnings. I saw competitors and\ncapital expenditures. Perhaps I should have seen all that when I analyzed\nthe Value Line reports, but for whatever reason, it did not resonate in\nthe same way. As I continued to read the Berkshire report, the entire\nworld of investing, which was still somewhat mysterious to me, began\nto open. That night, in one epiphanic moment, Warren Buffett revealed\nthe inner nature of investing.\nThe next morning, I was bursting with a newly discovered passion\nfor investing, and when the training class was completed, I quickly returned to Philadelphia with a single-minded purpose: I was going to invest my clients’ money in the same fashion as did Warren Buffett.\nI knew I needed to know more, so I started building a file of\nbackground information. First I obtained all the back copies of Berkshire Hathaway annual reports. Then I ordered the annual reports of\nall the publicly traded companies Buffett had invested with. Then I\ncollected all the magazine and newspaper articles on Warren Buffett I\ncould find.\nWhen the file was as complete as I could get it, I dove in. My goal\nwas to first become an expert on Warren Buffett and then share those\ninsights with my clients.\nOver the ensuing years, I built a respectable investment business. By\nfollowing Buffett’s teachings and stock picks, I achieved for my clients\nmore investment success than failure. Most of my clients intellectually\nbought into the approach of thinking about stocks as businesses and trying to buy the best businesses at a discount. The few clients who did not\nstick around left not because the Buffett approach was unsound, but because being contrarian was too much of an emotional challenge. And\na few left simply because they did not have enough patience to see the\nprocess succeed. They were impatient for activity, and the constant itch\nto do something—anything—drove them off the track. Looking back,\nI don’t believe I dealt with anyone who openly disagreed with the logic\nof Buffett’s investment approach, yet there were several who could not\nget the psychology right.\nAll the while, I continued to collect Buffett data. Annual reports,\nmagazine articles, interviews—anything having to do with Warren\nBuffett and Berkshire Hathaway, I read, analyzed, and filed. I was like a\nkid following a ballplayer. He was my hero, and each day I tried to\nswing the bat like Warren.\nAs the years passed, I had a growing and powerful urge to become a\nfull-time portfolio manager. At the time, investment brokers were compensated on their purchases and sales; it was largely a commission-based\nsystem. As a broker, I was getting the “buy” part of the equation right,\nbut Buffett’s emphasis on holding stocks for the long-term made the\n“sell” part of the equation more difficult. Today, most financial service\nbusinesses allow investment brokers and financial advisors to manage\nmoney for their clients for a fee instead of a commission—if they choose.\nEventually I met several portfolio managers who were compensated for\nperformance regardless of whether they did a lot of buying or selling.\nThis arrangement appeared to me to be the perfect environment in\nwhich to apply Buffett’s teachings.\nInitially, I gained some portfolio management experience at a local\nbank trust department in Philadelphia, and along the way obtained the\nobligatory Chartered Financial Analyst designation. Later, I joined a\nsmall investment counseling firm where I managed client portfolios for a\nfee. Our objective was to help our clients achieve a reasonable rate of return within an acceptable level of risk. Most had already achieved their\nfinancial goals, and now they wanted to preserve their wealth. Because of\nthis, many of the portfolios in our firm were balanced between stocks\nand bonds.\nIt was here that I began to put my thoughts about Buffett down\non paper, to share with our clients the wisdom of his investment approach. After all, Buffett, who had been investing for forty years, had\nbuilt up a pretty nice nest egg; learning more about how he did it certainly couldn’t hurt. These collected writings ultimately became the\nbasis for The Warren Buf fett Way.\nThe decision to start an equity mutual fund based on the principles\ndescribed in The Warren Buf fett Way came from two directions.\nFirst, our investment counseling firm needed an instrument to manage\nthose accounts that were not large enough to warrant a separately managed portfolio. Second, I wanted to establish a discretionary performance record that was based on the teachings of the book. I wanted to\ndemonstrate that what Buffett had taught and what I had written, if\nfollowed, would allow an investor to generate market-beating returns.\nThe proof would be in the performance.\nThe new fund was established on April 17, 1995. Armed with the\nknowledge gained by having studied Warren Buffett for over ten years,\ncoupled with the experience of managing portfolios for seven of those\nyears, I felt we were in a great position to help our clients achieve\nabove-average results. Instead, what we got was two very mediocre\nyears of investment performance.\nWhat happened?\nAs I analyzed the portfolio and the stock market during this period, I discovered two important but separate explanations. First, when\nI started the fund, I populated the portfolio mostly with Berkshire\nHathaway-type stocks: newspapers, beverage companies, other consumer nondurable businesses, and selected financial service companies.\nI even bought shares of Berkshire Hathaway.\nBecause my fund was a laboratory example of Buffett’s teachings,\nperhaps it was not surprising that many of the stocks in the portfolio\nwere stocks Buffett himself had purchased. But the difference between\nBuffett’s stocks in the 1980s and those same stocks in 1997 was\nstriking. Many of the companies that had consistently grown owner\nearnings at a double-digit rate in the 1980s were slowing to a high singledigit rate in the late 1990s. In addition, the stock prices of these companies had steadily risen over the decade and so the discount to intrinsic\nvalue was smaller compared with the earlier period. When the economics of your business slow and the discount to intrinsic value narrows, the\nfuture opportunity for outsized investment returns diminishes.\nIf the first factor was lack of high growth level inside the portfolio,\nthe second factor was what happening outside the portfolio. At the\nsame time that the economics of the businesses in the fund were\nslowing, the economics of certain technology companies—telecommunications, software, and Internet service providers—were sharply accelerating. Because these new industries were taking a larger share of\nthe market capitalization of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the stock\nmarket itself was rising at a faster clip. What I soon discovered was that\nthe economics of what I owned in the fund were no match for the\nnewer, more powerful technology-based companies then revving up in\nthe stock market.\nIn 1997, my fund was at the crossroads. If I continued to invest in\nthe traditional Buffett-like stocks, it was likely I would continue to generate just average results. Even Buffett was telling Berkshire Hathaway\nshareholders they could no longer expect to earn the above-average investment gains the company had achieved in the past. I knew if I continued to own the same stocks Buffett owned in his portfolio at these\nelevated prices, coupled with moderating economics, I was unlikely to\ngenerate above-average investment results for my shareholders. And in\nthat case, what was the purpose? If a mutual fund cannot generate, over\ntime, investment results better than the broad market index, then its\nshareholders would be better off in an index mutual fund.\nStanding at the investment crossroads during this period was dramatic. There were questions about whether the fund should continue.\nThere were questions about whether Buffett could compete against the\nnewer industries and still provide above-average results. And there was\nthe meta-question of whether the whole philosophy of thinking about\nstocks as businesses was a relevant approach when analyzing the newer\ntechnology-oriented industries.\nI knew in my heart that the Buffett approach to investing was still\nvalid. I knew without question that this business-analytical approach\nwould still provide the opportunity for investors to spot mispricing and\nthus profit from the market’s narrower view. I knew all these things\nand more, yet I momentarily hesitated at the shoreline, unable to cross\ninto the new economic landscape.\nI was fortunate to become friends with Bill Miller when I first\nbegan my career at Legg Mason. At the time, Bill was comanaging a\nvalue fund with Ernie Kiehne. Bill periodically spent time with the\nnewer investment brokers sharing his thoughts about the stock market,\nabout companies, and ideas from the countless books he had read. After\nI left Legg Mason to become a portfolio manager, Bill and I remained\nfriends. After The Warren Buf fett Way was published, we circled back\nfor more intense discussions about investing and the challenges of navigating the economic landscape.\nIn the book, I pointed out that Buffett did not rely solely on low\nP/E ratios to select stocks. The driving force in value creation was\nowner earnings and a company’s ability to generate above-average\nreturns on capital. Sometimes a stock with a low P/E ratio did generate\ncash and achieve high returns on capital and subsequently became a great\ninvestment. Other times, a stock with a low P/E ratio consumed cash\nBack then Microsoft was a $22 billion business that most value investors thought was significantly overvalued. By the end of 2003, Microsoft had grown to a $295 billion business. The company went up in price\nover 1,000 percent, while the S&P 500 Index advanced 138 percent during the same time period.\nWas Microsoft a value stock in 1993? It certainly looks like it was,\nyet no value investor would touch it. Is eBay a value stock today? We\nobviously believe it is, but we will not know for certain for some years\nto come. But one thing is clear to us: You cannot determine whether\neBay is a value stock by looking at its P/E any more than you could determine Microsoft’s valuation by looking at its P/E.\nAt the heart of all Bill’s investment decisions is the requirement of\nunderstanding a company’s business model. What are the value creators?\nHow does the company generate cash? What level of cash can a company\nproduce and what rate of growth can it expect to achieve? What is the\ncompany’s return on capital? If it achieves a return above the cost of capital, the company is creating value. If it achieves a rate of return below\nthe cost of capital, the company is destroying value.\nIn the end, Bill’s analysis gives him a sense of what the business is\nworth, based largely on the discounted present value of the company’s\nfuture cash earnings. Although Bill’s fund owns companies that are different from those in Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, no one can\ndeny that they are approaching the investment process in the same way.\nThe only difference is that Bill has decided to take the investment philosophy and apply it to the New Economy franchises that are rapidly\ndominating the global economic landscape.\nWhen Bill asked me to join Legg Mason Capital Management and\nbring my fund along, it was clear to me our philosophical approach was\nidentical. The more important advantage of joining Bill’s team was that\nnow I was part of an organization that was dedicated to applying a\nbusiness-valuation approach to investing wherever value-creation opportunities appeared. I was no longer limited to looking at just the\nstocks Buffett had purchased. The entire stock market was now open\nfor analysis. I guess you could say it forced me to expand my circle of\ncompetence.\nOne of my earliest thinking errors in managing my fund was the\nmistaken belief that because Buffett did not own high-tech companies, these businesses must have been inherently unanalyzable. Yes,\nthese newly created businesses possessed more economic risk than\nmany of the companies Buffett owned. The economics of soda pop,\nrazor blades, carpets, paint, candy, and furniture are much easier to\npredict than the economics of computer software, telecommunications, and the Internet.\nBut difficult to predict” is not the same as “impossible to analyze.” Certainly the economics of a technology company are more\nvariant than those of consumer nondurable businesses. But a thoughtful study of how any business operates should still allow us to determine a range of valuation possibilities. And keeping with the Buffett\nphilosophy, it is not critical that we determine precisely what the\nvalue of the company is, only that we are buying the company at a significant price discount (margin of safety) from the range of valuation\npossibilities.\nWhat some Buffettologists miss in their thinking is that the payoff\nof being right in the analysis of technology companies more than\ncompensates for the risk. All we must do is analyze each stock as a\nbusiness, determine the value of the business and, to protect against\nhigher economic risk, demand a greater margin of safety in the purchase price.\nWe should not forget that over the years many devotees of Warren\nBuffett’s investment approach have taken his philosophy and applied it to\ndifferent parts of the stock market. Several prominent investors have\nbought stocks not found anywhere in Berkshire’s portfolio. Others have\nbought smaller-capitalization stocks. A few have taken Buffett’s approach\ninto the international market and purchased foreign securities. The important takeaway is this: Buffett’s investment approach is applicable to all\ntypes of businesses, regardless of industry, regardless of market capitalization, regardless of where the business is domiciled.\nSince becoming part of Legg Mason Capital Management in 1998,\nmy growth fund has enjoyed a remarkable period of superior investment performance. The reason for this much better performance is not\nthat the philosophy or process changed, but that the philosophy and\nprocess were applied to a larger universe of stocks. When portfolio\nmanagers and analysts are willing to study all types of business models,\nregardless of industry classification, the opportunity to exploit the market’s periodic mispricing greatly expands, and this translates into better\nreturns for our shareholders.\nThis does not mean we do not have an occasional bad year, bad\nquarter, or bad month. It simply means when you add up all the times\nwe lost money relative to the market, using any time period, the amount\nof money we lost was smaller than the amount of money we made when\nwe outperformed the market.\nIn this respect, the record of this fund is not far different from other\nfocused portfolios. Think back to the performance of Charlie Munger,\nBill Ruane, and Lou Simpson. Each one achieved outstanding longterm performance but endured periods of short-term underperformance. Each one employed a business valuation process to determine\nwhether stocks were mispriced. Each one ran concentrated, lowturnover portfolios. The process they used enabled them to achieve superior long-term results at the expense of a higher standard deviation.\nMichael Mauboussin, the chief investment strategist at Legg Mason\nCapital Management, conducted a study of the best-performing mutual\nfunds between 1992 and 2002.1 He screened for funds that had one\nmanager during the period, had assets of at least $1 billion, and beat the\nStandard & Poor’s 500 Index over the ten-year period. Thirty-one mutual funds made the cut.\nThen he looked at the process each manager used to beat the market, and isolated four attributes that set this group apart from the majority of fund managers.\n1. Portfolio turnover. As a whole, the market-beating mutual funds\nhad an average turnover ratio of about 30 percent. This stands in\nstark contrast to the turnover for all equity funds—110 percent.\n2. Portfolio concentration. The long-term outperformers tend to\nhave higher portfolio concentration than the index or other general equity funds. On average, the outperforming mutual funds\nplaced 37 percent of their assets in their top ten names.\n3. Investment style. The vast majority of the above-market performers espoused an intrinsic-value approach to selecting stocks.\n4. Geographic location. Only a small fraction of the outperformers\nhail from the East Coast financial centers, New York or\nBoston. Most of the high-alpha generators set up shop in cities\nlike Chicago, Salt Lake City, Memphis, Omaha, and Baltimore.\nMichael suggests that perhaps being away from the frenetic pace\nof New York and Boston lessens the hyperactivity that permeates so many mutual fund portfolios.\nA common thread for outperformance, whether it be for the Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville, the Superinvestors of Buffettville,\nor those who lead the funds that Michael’s research identified, is a portfolio strategy that emphasizes concentrated bets and low turnover and a\nstock-selection process that emphasizes the discovery of a stock’s intrinsic value.\nStill, with all the evidence on how to generate above-average long\nresults, a vast majority of money managers continue to underperform\nthe stock market. Some believe this is evidence of market efficiency.\nPerhaps with the intense competition among money managers, stocks\nare more accurately priced. This may be partly true. We believe the\nmarket has become more efficient, and there are fewer opportunities to\nextract profits from the stock market using simple-minded techniques\nto determine value. Surely no one still believes the market is going to\nallow you to pick its pocket simply by calculating a P/E ratio.\nAnalysts who understand the deep-rooted changes unfolding in a\nbusiness model will likely discover valuation anomalies that appear in the\nmarket. Those analysts will have a different view of the duration and\nmagnitude of the company’s cash-generating ability compared with the\nmarket’s view. “That the S&P 500 has also beaten other active money\nmanagers is not an argument against active money management,” said\nBill Miller; “it is an argument against the methods employed by most\nactive money managers.”2\nIt has been twenty years since I read my first Berkshire Hathaway annual report. Even now, when I think about Warren Buffett and his philosophy, it fills me with excitement and passion for the world of\ninvesting. There is no doubt in my mind that the process is sound and,\nif consistently applied, will generate above-average long-term results.\nWe have only to observe today’s best-in-class money managers to see\nthat they are all using varied forms of Buffett’s investment approach.\nAlthough companies, industries, markets, and economies will always evolve over time, the value of Buffett’s investment philosophy lies\nin its timelessness. No matter what the condition, investors can apply\nBuffett’s approach to selecting stocks and managing portfolios.\nWhen Buffett first started managing money in the 1950s and\n1960s, he was thinking about stocks as businesses and managing focused\nportfolios. When he added the new economic franchises to Berkshire’s\nportfolio in the 1970s and 1980s, he was still thinking about stocks as\nbusinesses and managing a focused portfolio. When Bill Miller bought\ntechnology and Internet companies for his value fund in the 1990s and\ninto the first half of this decade, he was thinking about stocks as businesses and managing a focused portfolio.\nWere the companies purchased in the 1950s different from the companies in the 1980s? Yes. Were the companies purchased in the 1960s different from those purchased in 1990s? Of course they were. Businesses\nchange, industries unfold, and the competitiveness of markets allows new\neconomic franchises to be born while others slowly wither. Throughout\nthe constant evolution of markets and companies, it should be comforting\nfor investors to realize there is an investment process that remains robust\neven against the inevitable forces of change.\nAt Berskhire’s 2004 annual meeting, a shareholder asked Warren\nwhether, looking back, he would change anything about his approach.\n“If we were to do it over again, we’d do it pretty much the same way,”\nhe answered. “We’d read everything in sight about businesses and industries. Working with far less capital, our investment universe would be far\nbroader than it is currently. I would continually learn the basic principles\nof sound investing which are Ben Graham’s, affected in a significant way\nby Charlie and Phil Fisher in terms of looking at better businesses.” He\npaused for a moment, then added, “There’s nothing different, in my\nview, about analyzing securities today versus fifty years ago.”\nNor will there be anything different five, ten, or twenty years from\nnow. Markets change, prices change, economic environments change,\nindustries come and go. And smart investors change their day-to-day\nbehavior to adapt to the changing context. What does not change, however, are the fundamentals.\nThose who follow Buffett’s way will still analyze stocks (and companies) according to the same tenets; will maintain a focus portfolio;\nand will ignore bumps, dips, and bruises. They believe, as I do, that the\nprinciples that have guided Warren Buffett’s investment decisions for\nsome sixty years are indeed timeless, and provide a foundation of solid\ninvestment wisdom on which all of us may build."
