Introduction
============

Background
----------
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. However, fine-tuning these models for specific domains or personalities while maintaining efficiency remains a challenge. This is where Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) comes in, offering a resource-efficient method for adapting large language models.

Why Warren Buffett?
-----------------
Warren Buffett, known as the "Oracle of Omaha," represents one of the most successful and systematic approaches to investment and business analysis. His clear communication style, consistent principles, and decades of written material make him an ideal subject for specialized language model adaptation.

Project Objectives
----------------
1. **Domain Adaptation**: Fine-tune a large language model to specifically understand and generate content in Warren Buffett's investment style
2. **Efficient Learning**: Demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRA in capturing domain-specific knowledge
3. **Practical Application**: Create a model that can analyze investment opportunities and provide insights using Buffett's principles
4. **Methodology Validation**: Evaluate the effectiveness of our approach through various metrics and real-world applications

Research Questions
----------------
- How effectively can LoRA capture the nuanced investment wisdom of Warren Buffett?
- What are the optimal hyperparameters for fine-tuning with LoRA in this context?
- How does the adapted model perform in terms of generating authentic Buffett-style analysis?
- What are the limitations and potential biases in the fine-tuned model?
