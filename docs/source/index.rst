About FinGPT-Powered Agents
---------------------------
The **FinGPT-Powered Agents Framework** leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), modular components, and the MCP protocol to enable flexible, powerful, and transparent financial decision-making agents. This framework allows developers to integrate real-time market data, user-specific portfolios, remote analytics services, and advanced computational tools seamlessly into financial agents.


Key Features
------------

- **Modular Component Protocol (MCP)**: Standardized interactions between LLMs, tools, and data.
- **Flexible Architecture**: Easily integrate and swap modular components.
- **Real-Time Financial Data**: Integration with remote services such as market APIs, brokerage accounts, and analytical tools.
- **Personalized Financial Advisory**: Customizable financial agents tailored to individual investor profiles and preferences.


Buffett-Agent as an Example
---------------------------

One notable implementation of the FinGPT-Powered Agents Framework is the **Buffett-Agent**, an LLM-based financial advisory agent fine-tuned on Warren Buffett's investing principles and methodologies. Detailed documentation for the Buffett-Agent implementation, including fine-tuning strategies, datasets, experimental results, and analysis, can be found in the dedicated section:
