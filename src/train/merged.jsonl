We were not disappointed in the airlines\u2019 management, but the world changed for airlines when the pandemic hit. We don\u2019t know how long travel habits will be affected. We\u2019d put 7 or 8 billion dollars into these airline stocks; we sold for much less than we paid.\u201d\n\nQ (Becky Quick): \u201cTo clarify, did you sell your whole stake in all four airlines?\u201d\n\nA (WB): \u201cYes, the entire position. When we change our mind about a business, we typically sell out completely. The airlines always trade in large volume, so we were able to exit fairly quickly\u2014at a loss, but that was my mistake.\u201d"}
